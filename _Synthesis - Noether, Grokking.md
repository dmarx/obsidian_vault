>my mistake, the invariance should be the network topology. we are trying to elucidate what conserved quantities here might be. intuitively, it should be expressable in a form similar to a lagrangian in whose terms probably relate the information content, size, or structure of the dataset to the representational capacity of the model, the variance explained by the model, the change in model's performance over training, etc.

Revisiting the scenario with a focus on network topology as an invariant and exploring the potential conserved quantities through a formulation akin to a Lagrangian in physics, we can draw a deeper analogy to Noether's theorem and its implications in the context of neural networks and their learning dynamics. Here, the aim is to relate the structure and information content of the dataset to the representational capacity of the model and its performance metrics.

### Re-framing the Scenario

Given:
- A neural network \( \mathcal{N} \) with a fixed topology \( T \) as the invariant under the learning process.
- The learning dynamics are governed by a process (e.g., SGD) that minimizes a loss function \( L \) over a dataset \( D \), which introduces information content \( I(D) \), to the model \( \mathcal{N} \) with representational capacity \( C(\mathcal{N}) \).

We seek to identify conserved quantities emerging from the invariance of \( T \) that might be analogous to energy conservation in physical systems as derived from Noether's theorem.

### Formulating a "Lagrangian" for Learning Dynamics

To construct a Lagrangian-like function \( \mathcal{L} \) for the learning dynamics, consider the following components:
- **Kinetic Term \( K \)**: Represents the change in the model's performance over training, possibly quantified by the rate of decrease in the loss function \( L \) or the improvement in a performance metric over time.
- **Potential Term \( U \)**: Encapsulates the model's representational capacity \( C(\mathcal{N}) \) and the variance explained by \( \mathcal{N} \) on the dataset \( D \). This could include terms that represent the "fit" of \( \mathcal{N} \) to \( D \) and the complexity of \( \mathcal{N} \) as constraints on \( C(\mathcal{N}) \).

Then, the "Lagrangian" \( \mathcal{L} = K - U \) aims to balance the rate of learning (kinetic) against the representational capacity and fit (potential), reflecting the dynamics of training \( \mathcal{N} \) on \( D \).

### Identifying Conserved Quantities

Given the invariant topology \( T \), and assuming \( \mathcal{L} \) adequately captures the learning dynamics, conserved quantities emerge as features of the learning process that remain constant over time, despite variations in other aspects like initial weights or specific instances of \( D \).

1. **Information-Performance Balance**: A conserved quantity might be the balance between the information content \( I(D) \) that \( D \) introduces to \( \mathcal{N} \) and the variance explained by \( \mathcal{N} \). This balance reflects how efficiently \( \mathcal{N} \) utilizes its representational capacity \( C(\mathcal{N}) \) to capture and generalize from \( D \).

2. **Structural Efficiency**: The efficiency of \( \mathcal{N} \)'s topology \( T \) in encoding the learned representations from \( D \), considering the trade-off between complexity (e.g., number of parameters) and performance (e.g., accuracy). This efficiency could be seen as a conserved quantity that characterizes the "optimality" of \( T \) for learning tasks.

### Formal Statement

**Theorem (Conservation in Learning Dynamics):**
Given a neural network \( \mathcal{N} \) with invariant topology \( T \) learning from a dataset \( D \), if the learning process is governed by a Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) that captures the kinetic and potential terms of learning, then the efficiency of \( \mathcal{N} \)'s use of its representational capacity \( C(\mathcal{N}) \) to generalize from \( D \) is conserved under the transformations governed by the learning dynamics.

### Conclusion

This formalization presents an innovative perspective on understanding neural network learning dynamics through the lens of Noether's symmetry principles, positing that the invariant topology of a neural network leads to conserved quantities that reflect the balance between information content, representational capacity, and structural efficiency. This approach not only enriches the theoretical understanding of neural network learning but also suggests new avenues for exploring the design and optimization of neural architectures.

>kinetic and potential terms should probably relate to batch size and learning rate

Integrating the concepts of batch size and learning rate into the kinetic and potential terms of a "Lagrangian" for learning dynamics in neural networks offers a nuanced view of the training process, emphasizing the role of these hyperparameters in shaping the model's trajectory through parameter space. Here's how we might formalize this relationship:

### Revisiting the "Lagrangian" Concept

The "Lagrangian" \( \mathcal{L} \) in the context of neural network training can be conceptualized as a function that captures the balance between two competing aspects of the learning dynamics:

- **Kinetic Term \( K \)**: Associated with the learning rate, reflecting how rapidly the model updates its weights and moves through the parameter space. A higher learning rate could signify greater "kinetic energy" in this analogy, leading to faster traversals of the parameter space.
  
- **Potential Term \( U \)**: Linked to the batch size, which influences the stability and accuracy of the gradient estimates. A larger batch size can be seen as providing a more stable "potential field" by reducing the variance in the gradient estimates, potentially leading to a smoother optimization landscape.

### Formal Definitions

Let:
- \( \eta \) denote the learning rate,
- \( B \) denote the batch size, and
- \( \nabla L \) represent the gradient of the loss function \( L \) with respect to the model's parameters.

#### Kinetic Term \( K(\eta) \)

The kinetic term could be modeled as a function of the learning rate \( \eta \), where higher \( \eta \) values correspond to greater "momentum" or "agility" in exploring the parameter space. One possible formulation is:

\[ K(\eta) = \frac{1}{2} \eta^2 \|\nabla L\|^2 \]

This reflects the idea that the "energy" or "effort" expended in updating the weights increases with both the magnitude of the learning rate and the steepness of the gradient.

#### Potential Term \( U(B) \)

The potential term could depend inversely on the batch size \( B \), reflecting how larger batches tend to stabilize the training landscape:

\[ U(B) = \frac{\alpha}{B} \]

where \( \alpha \) is a constant that scales the influence of \( B \). This captures the notion that larger batches provide a more accurate estimate of the true gradient, reducing the "noise" or "variance" in the training process, analogous to a more stable potential field.

### "Lagrangian" \( \mathcal{L} \)

Combining these, the "Lagrangian" for the learning dynamics can be expressed as:

\[ \mathcal{L}(\eta, B) = K(\eta) - U(B) \]

### Conservation Law and Symmetry

Given this setup, the conservation law derived from Noether's theorem might relate to the balance between exploration and stability in the learning process. Specifically, for any given trajectory in parameter space, there exists a balance between the learning rate and batch size that conserves the efficiency of learning—achieving rapid convergence without sacrificing the fidelity of the gradient estimates.

### Corollaries

1. **Optimal Learning Dynamics**: There exists an optimal combination of \( \eta \) and \( B \) that maximizes the efficiency of the learning process, balancing rapid convergence with accurate gradient estimation.
  
2. **Adaptive Strategies**: Adaptive learning rate strategies (e.g., learning rate schedules or adaptive optimizers) and dynamic batching techniques can be viewed as methods to maintain or optimize this conservation law throughout training, adjusting \( \eta \) and \( B \) to navigate the parameter space effectively.

### Conclusion

By conceptualizing the learning rate and batch size as components of a kinetic and potential term in a learning dynamics "Lagrangian," we can formalize the interplay between these hyperparameters and the training process. This perspective not only provides a novel way to understand the impact of \( \eta \) and \( B \) on training but also aligns with the broader principles of symmetry and conservation, suggesting a deep structural harmony in the optimization landscape of neural networks.

>incorporate critical exponents into this framework so we can use these principles to analyze critical phenomena in learning dynamics analogously to how we study critical phenomena in other domains where noether's symmetry principles apply. express all relationships formally and concretely.

Incorporating critical exponents into the framework of learning dynamics, particularly in the context of neural networks, allows us to analyze critical phenomena—such as phase transitions in learning behavior—with an approach analogous to the study of critical phenomena in physics. This analysis leverages the conceptual foundation of Noether's symmetry principles and introduces a formalism to capture how learning dynamics exhibit critical behavior near phase transitions, characterized by critical exponents.

### Defining the Framework

1. **Phase Transition in Learning Dynamics**: Define a phase transition in the context of neural network training as a dramatic change in the learning behavior or the model's performance, potentially occurring when key hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate \(\eta\), batch size \(B\)) cross certain thresholds.

2. **Critical Point**: A set of values \((\eta_c, B_c)\) at which the phase transition occurs is referred to as the critical point. Near this critical point, certain properties of the learning process exhibit power-law behavior characterized by critical exponents.

3. **Critical Exponents**: Critical exponents \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \dots\) describe the behavior of various quantities (e.g., model performance metrics, gradient norm) as the system (learning process) approaches the critical point. For example, the exponent \(\alpha\) might describe how the "specific heat" (analogous to variance in performance improvement) diverges near \(\eta_c, B_c\).

### Formal Representation

Given the "Lagrangian" \(\mathcal{L}(\eta, B)\) for learning dynamics with kinetic term \(K(\eta)\) and potential term \(U(B)\), as previously defined, we extend this to analyze critical behavior:

\[ \mathcal{L}(\eta, B) = K(\eta) - U(B) \]

#### Near the Critical Point

Near the critical point \((\eta_c, B_c)\), assume quantities of interest \(Q\) (e.g., variance in loss reduction per epoch) exhibit scaling behavior described by:

\[ Q(\delta\eta, \delta B) \sim |\delta\eta|^{\alpha}f_{Q}\left(\frac{|\delta B|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi}}\right) \]

where:
- \(\delta\eta = \eta - \eta_c\) and \(\delta B = B - B_c\) represent deviations from the critical point,
- \(\alpha\) is a critical exponent characterizing the scaling behavior of \(Q\) with respect to \(\delta\eta\),
- \(\phi\) is a crossover exponent that describes how the scaling behaviors transition between different regimes controlled by \(\eta\) and \(B\),
- \(f_{Q}\) is a scaling function that describes the combined effect of deviations in \(\eta\) and \(B\).

### Corollaries and Implications

1. **Adaptive Learning and Critical Phenomena**: Adaptive strategies that adjust \(\eta\) and \(B\) dynamically can be seen as navigating the learning process near or away from critical regions, optimizing learning efficiency while avoiding undesirable phase transitions (e.g., from stable to chaotic learning dynamics).

2. **Generalization and Criticality**: The relationship between model generalization and proximity to critical points can be formalized, hypothesizing that optimal generalization capacity may arise near criticality, where the system is sensitive to inputs and can capture complex patterns more effectively.

3. **Symmetry-Breaking and Model Complexity**: The onset of phase transitions in the learning process might be associated with symmetry-breaking phenomena, where the model's representational capacity (\(C(\mathcal{N})\)) increases dramatically, allowing for a qualitative change in the learning behavior.

### Conclusion

By extending the formalism of learning dynamics to incorporate critical exponents and analyze critical phenomena analogously to physical systems, this framework offers a rich ground for exploring the complex behavior of neural networks during training. It suggests that navigating the parameter space of neural networks involves understanding and exploiting the underlying symmetries and critical phenomena, providing a deeper insight into the dynamics of learning and generalization.

>assume phase transitions in performance are indicative of critical points at which the learned manifold undergoes a structural reorganization, likely associated with an increase in rank/order. incorporate this in your formalization and elucidate consequences on how certain critical exponents in this model could be interpreted or connected to hyperparameters

Incorporating the notion that phase transitions in neural network performance indicate critical points at which the learned manifold undergoes a structural reorganization, potentially associated with an increase in rank or order, we can extend our formal framework to capture these phenomena. This perspective allows for a deeper understanding of how the structural properties of the learned representations evolve during training, particularly at critical junctures marked by significant changes in performance. Let's formalize this concept and explore its implications.

### Extended Framework

#### Structural Reorganization and Rank Increase

1. **Learned Manifold \( \mathcal{M} \)**: Let the learned manifold \( \mathcal{M} \) represent the geometric structure in the parameter space \( \Theta \) that encodes the neural network's learned representations. The manifold's structure is shaped by the training process, influenced by hyperparameters such as the learning rate \( \eta \) and batch size \( B \).

2. **Critical Points and Phase Transitions**: At critical points \((\eta_c, B_c)\), the network experiences phase transitions in performance, indicative of a structural reorganization of \( \mathcal{M} \). This reorganization can be associated with an increase in the rank or order of \( \mathcal{M} \), reflecting a more complex or higher-dimensional representation being learned.

#### Formalization

3. **Rank Increase at Critical Points**: Near critical points, the rank of \( \mathcal{M} \), denoted as \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \), increases, signaling a phase transition. This can be expressed as a function of deviations from critical hyperparameters:

\[ \Delta \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \sim |\delta\eta|^{\alpha} + |\delta B|^{\beta} \]

where:
- \( \Delta \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \) is the change in rank of \( \mathcal{M} \),
- \( \delta\eta = \eta - \eta_c \) and \( \delta B = B - B_c \) are deviations from critical hyperparameters,
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are critical exponents indicating the sensitivity of \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \) to changes in \( \eta \) and \( B \), respectively.

### Consequences and Interpretation

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The critical exponents \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) characterize how the structural complexity of the learned representations (as quantified by \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \)) responds to changes in learning rate and batch size. Larger values of \( \alpha \) or \( \beta \) indicate greater sensitivity of the learning process's structural evolution to these hyperparameters.

2. **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning**: Understanding the relationship between \( \eta \), \( B \), and \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \) could guide adaptive hyperparameter tuning strategies that aim to navigate through or avoid critical points, depending on whether a phase transition is deemed beneficial or detrimental to learning outcomes.

3. **Phase Transitions as Learning Milestones**: The occurrence of phase transitions, marked by increases in \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \), can be interpreted as milestones in the learning process where the network gains the ability to represent and generalize from more complex patterns in the data.

4. **Generalization and Criticality**: The approach to critical points and the associated increase in the representational capacity (higher rank of \( \mathcal{M} \)) may correspond to enhanced generalization abilities. However, this relationship is nuanced and likely depends on the nature of the data and task, as well as the specific architecture of the neural network.

### Conclusion

By extending the framework to consider phase transitions as indicative of critical points where the learned manifold undergoes structural reorganization, we gain insights into the deep connections between the geometry of learning, hyperparameter settings, and the evolution of neural network performance. Critical exponents \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) emerge as key parameters that describe the sensitivity of the network's representational structure to the learning rate and batch size, offering a principled way to understand and navigate the complex landscape of neural network training.

---

To incorporate the concept of phase transitions in neural network performance as indicative of critical points at which the learned manifold undergoes structural reorganization—often associated with an increase in rank or order—we'll expand the formalism to include this phenomenon. We'll focus on how the changes in the learned manifold's structure can be linked to hyperparameters through critical exponents.

### Expanded Framework for Learning Dynamics

1. **Structural Reorganization and Phase Transitions**: Define a phase transition in learning dynamics as occurring at critical hyperparameter settings \((\eta_c, B_c)\) where the model's learned representation manifold undergoes a significant structural reorganization, marked by an increase in rank or complexity (order).

2. **Critical Exponents and Manifold Structure**: Critical exponents \(\nu, \mu, \dots\) describe how the properties of the learned manifold, such as its dimensionality (rank) or complexity (order), change as hyperparameters approach their critical values.

### Formalization

Given a model \( \mathcal{N} \) parameterized by weights \( W \), learning from data \( D \) with a loss landscape represented in the parameter space \( \Theta \):

- **Learned Manifold \( M \)**: The subspace of \( \Theta \) effectively utilized by \( \mathcal{N} \) in representing data \( D \), potentially characterized by metrics like dimensionality or topological complexity.
- **Hyperparameters \( (\eta, B) \)**: Learning rate \(\eta\) and batch size \(B\) directly influence the trajectory \( \Gamma \) in \( \Theta \) and consequently the structure of \( M \).

#### Phase Transition and Criticality

- **Phase Transition at \( (\eta_c, B_c) \)**: At critical values, \( (\eta_c, B_c) \), there's a marked phase transition in model performance, associated with a structural reorganization of \( M \). This can be formalized as:
  \[ \lim_{(\eta,B) \to (\eta_c,B_c)} \Delta Rank(M) = \infty, \]
  where \( \Delta Rank(M) \) denotes the change in rank or order of \( M \).

#### Critical Exponents

- **Critical Exponent \( \nu \)**: Describes how the dimensionality of \( M \) scales near the critical point:
  \[ Dim(M) \sim |\eta - \eta_c|^{-\nu}. \]
  
- **Critical Exponent \( \mu \)**: Captures the scaling behavior of the topological complexity (or order) of \( M \) near the critical point:
  \[ Complexity(M) \sim |B - B_c|^{-\mu}. \]

### Consequences and Interpretations

1. **Learning Rate \( \eta \) and Dimensionality**: The critical exponent \( \nu \) suggests that as \( \eta \) approaches \( \eta_c \), the effective dimensionality of the learned manifold \( M \) dramatically increases, potentially indicating more complex representations being formed as the model nears a phase transition in performance.

2. **Batch Size \( B \) and Topological Complexity**: The critical exponent \( \mu \) implies that changes in \( B \) near \( B_c \) significantly impact the topological complexity of \( M \), reflecting how the model's capacity to capture intricate data structures varies with batch size at critical learning junctures.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Phase Transitions**: Tuning \( \eta \) and \( B \) not only affects the speed and stability of convergence but also fundamentally influences the structure and complexity of the representations that \( \mathcal{N} \) learns. Navigating near critical points can enhance the model's ability to learn richer representations but may also introduce risks of overfitting or catastrophic forgetting.

### Conclusion

By extending the formalism to capture phase transitions in neural network learning as structural reorganizations of the learned manifold, marked by critical exponents, we establish a nuanced understanding of how hyperparameters influence the representational capacity and complexity of models. This approach, inspired by Noether's symmetry principles and the study of critical phenomena, offers profound insights into the interplay between learning dynamics, model structure, and performance, highlighting the delicate balance required in hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal learning outcomes.

>"grokking" phenomena observed in the dynamics of loss functions through the duration of training are a critical phenomenon we would like to characterize within this framework. we will need to incorporate training duration and relate it to our earlier notions of invariance over the family of model parameterizations and relate the "potential" that combines the information content in the dataset and with a conservation law that relates the explained variance in the model to the "kinetic" hyperparameters (training duration, batch size, learning rate) that relate the rate at which that potential change impacts the state of the model with respect to the invariance of the "action" in this system as expressed in the lagrangian that represents the learning dynamics

To characterize the "grokking" phenomenon—where a sudden leap in model understanding or performance occurs relatively late in the training process—within the formalized framework of learning dynamics, we'll extend the "Lagrangian" concept to incorporate training duration. This extension allows us to explore how grokking can be viewed as a critical phenomenon associated with specific conditions in the training dynamics, involving the interplay between the "kinetic" aspects (learning rate, batch size, training duration) and the "potential" related to the information content in the dataset.

### Extending the Framework to Include Training Duration

1. **Training Duration \( \tau \)**: Introduce training duration \( \tau \) as a hyperparameter that, alongside learning rate \( \eta \) and batch size \( B \), influences the kinetic term of the learning dynamics.

2. **Potential Term \( U \)**: Define \( U \) to incorporate the information content \( I(D) \) of the dataset \( D \) and its relationship with the explained variance \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) by the model \( \mathcal{N} \). The potential reflects the model's capacity to capture and represent the dataset's underlying structure.

### Modified Lagrangian for Learning Dynamics

Given the kinetic components \( \eta, B, \tau \), and the potential component \( U \), the Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) representing the learning dynamics can be expressed as:

\[ \mathcal{L}(\eta, B, \tau; U) = K(\eta, B, \tau) - U(I(D), V(\mathcal{N}, D)) \]

where:
- \( K(\eta, B, \tau) \) captures the model's rate of change or adaptation in response to the training process, influenced by the learning rate, batch size, and training duration.
- \( U(I(D), V(\mathcal{N}, D)) \) reflects the potential for the model to learn from the dataset, considering the dataset's information content and how well the model explains its variance.

### Characterizing Grokking

The "grokking" phenomenon can be described as a critical transition in the learning dynamics where the model suddenly achieves a significantly better understanding of the data. Formally, grokking occurs when there is a rapid increase in \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) while maintaining the invariance of the action represented by \( \mathcal{L} \).

#### Critical Conditions for Grokking

- Grokking is facilitated by reaching a critical point in the learning dynamics where the contributions of \( K \) and \( U \) to \( \mathcal{L} \) become optimally aligned. This may involve specific combinations of \( \eta, B, \) and \( \tau \) that maximize the rate of improvement in \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) given \( I(D) \).

#### Conservation Law and Grokking

- A conservation law in this context relates the explained variance \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) to the kinetic hyperparameters (\( \eta, B, \tau \)) under the invariance of the action \( \mathcal{L} \). Specifically, even as \( \eta, B, \), and \( \tau \) vary over the course of training, the total "action" captured by \( \mathcal{L} \) remains invariant, facilitating a sudden transition in model performance (grokking) when critical conditions are met.

### Implications

1. **Optimization of Hyperparameters**: Identifying the optimal conditions that facilitate grokking involves tuning \( \eta, B, \) and \( \tau \) to approach the critical point in the learning dynamics where the potential for learning from \( D \) is maximally realized.

2. **Monitoring Learning Progress**: The framework suggests that monitoring the balance between \( K \) and \( U \) can provide early indicators of approaching a grokking phase, allowing for adaptive adjustments to the training regime to capitalize on this phenomenon.

### Conclusion

By extending the formalized learning dynamics framework to include training duration and examining its interplay with the learning rate, batch size, and the dataset's information content, we can capture the grokking phenomenon as a critical transition facilitated by specific training conditions. This analysis underscores the importance of understanding the underlying dynamics of neural network training to optimize learning outcomes and harness critical phenomena like grokking effectively.

>incorporate critical exponents in this formulation of learning dynamics and grokking

Incorporating critical exponents into the formulation of learning dynamics, especially in the context of understanding the "grokking" phenomenon, allows us to quantitatively describe how near-critical conditions affect the model's performance and the manifestation of grokking. Critical exponents will help us characterize the behavior of the system as it approaches a critical point in the parameter space, defined by the learning rate (\(\eta\)), batch size (\(B\)), and training duration (\(\tau\)).

### Extended Framework with Critical Exponents

1. **Critical Point \((\eta_c, B_c, \tau_c)\)**: Assume that there exists a critical point in the learning dynamics space where grokking is likely to occur. This point is characterized by critical values of the hyperparameters \(\eta_c\), \(B_c\), and \(\tau_c\).

2. **Critical Exponents \((\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\)**: Define critical exponents that describe how the learning dynamics behave near the critical point. For instance:
   - \(\alpha\) may describe how the model's ability to explain variance in the dataset (\(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\)) diverges as \(\tau\) approaches \(\tau_c\).
   - \(\beta\) could characterize the sensitivity of \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) to changes in \(\eta\) near \(\eta_c\).
   - \(\gamma\) might represent the change in \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) with respect to variations in \(B\) close to \(B_c\).

### Formalizing Learning Dynamics and Grokking with Critical Exponents

Given the "Lagrangian" \( \mathcal{L}(\eta, B, \tau; U) = K(\eta, B, \tau) - U(I(D), V(\mathcal{N}, D)) \), we incorporate the critical exponents as follows:

\[ V(\mathcal{N}, D) \sim |\tau - \tau_c|^{\alpha} F\left( |\eta - \eta_c|^{\beta}, |\tau - \tau_c|^{\gamma} \right) \]

where \(F\) is a scaling function that combines the effects of \(\eta\) and \(\tau\) (or \(B\)) near their critical values, reflecting the complex interplay of hyperparameters in triggering grokking.

### Implications of Critical Exponents in Learning Dynamics

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The values of the critical exponents (\(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\)) indicate the sensitivity of the learning process's ability to capture and represent information as it nears the critical point. High sensitivity (large exponent values) suggests that small changes in hyperparameters can lead to significant impacts on learning outcomes, potentially triggering grokking.

2. **Predicting Grokking**: By analyzing the behavior of \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) in terms of the critical exponents, we can potentially predict when grokking will occur during training. This involves monitoring for signs that the system is approaching a critical state as indicated by the scaling laws.

3. **Optimizing Towards Criticality**: Understanding the role of critical exponents can guide the optimization of hyperparameters (\(\eta, B, \tau\)) to deliberately approach the critical point, aiming to induce grokking and achieve rapid leaps in learning performance.

### Conclusion

By incorporating critical exponents into the formulation of learning dynamics, we gain a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the grokking phenomenon in neural network training. This approach allows for a quantitative description of how changes in learning rate, batch size, and training duration influence the system's behavior near criticality, offering insights into optimizing training protocols to harness the benefits of grokking. The analysis underscores the nuanced interplay between hyperparameters and the emergent properties of learning dynamics, highlighting the potential for critical phenomena to play a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs in model performance.

---

To incorporate critical exponents into the formulation of learning dynamics, especially in the context of understanding the "grokking" phenomenon, we must consider how the model's performance metrics and the system's properties scale near the critical point. Critical exponents will describe how various quantities related to the learning process behave as the system approaches this point, providing insight into the nature of the transition represented by grokking.

### Extended Framework with Critical Exponents

1. **Critical Point \((\eta_c, B_c, \tau_c)\)**: Define the critical point in terms of learning rate \(\eta\), batch size \(B\), and training duration \(\tau\), where \(\eta_c, B_c\), and \(\tau_c\) represent the critical values at which grokking occurs.

2. **Critical Exponents \((\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\)**: Introduce critical exponents to describe the behavior of key quantities as the system approaches the critical point. Specifically:
   - \(\alpha\) describes how the "specific heat" (analogous to the variance in model improvement) diverges.
   - \(\beta\) relates to the order parameter, such as the rate of increase in explained variance \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\), near grokking.
   - \(\gamma\) characterizes the susceptibility or responsiveness of the model's performance to changes in hyperparameters near the critical point.

### Formal Representation

#### Critical Behavior of Learning Dynamics

Assuming a near-critical scaling form for the explained variance \(V\) and the "specific heat" \(C\), we can express these near the critical point as:

\[ V(\delta\eta, \delta B, \delta\tau) \sim |\delta\eta|^{\beta}f_V\left(\frac{|\delta B|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_B}}, \frac{|\delta\tau|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_{\tau}}}\right) \]

\[ C(\delta\eta, \delta B, \delta\tau) \sim |\delta\eta|^{-\alpha}f_C\left(\frac{|\delta B|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_B}}, \frac{|\delta\tau|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_{\tau}}}\right) \]

where:
- \(\delta\eta = \eta - \eta_c\), \(\delta B = B - B_c\), \(\delta\tau = \tau - \tau_c\) are deviations from the critical hyperparameters,
- \(f_V\) and \(f_C\) are scaling functions for \(V\) and \(C\), respectively,
- \(\phi_B\) and \(\phi_{\tau}\) are crossover exponents that govern the relative scaling of batch size and training duration to the learning rate.

### Consequences and Interpretation

1. **Sensitivity and Scaling Near Grokking**: The critical exponents \(\alpha, \beta,\) and \(\gamma\) provide a quantitative measure of how the learning dynamics become increasingly sensitive as the system approaches the grokking transition. For example, a small change in \(\eta\) near \(\eta_c\) could lead to a significant increase in \(V\), indicating a phase transition in learning capability.

2. **Optimization Strategies**: Understanding the scaling behavior near the critical point can inform strategies for dynamically adjusting \(\eta, B,\) and \(\tau\) to induce or avoid grokking, depending on whether this phenomenon aligns with the desired learning outcomes.

3. **Phase Diagram of Learning**: The relationships defined by critical exponents allow for the construction of a phase diagram for the learning process, mapping out regions of parameter space where grokking is likely to occur. This diagram can guide the selection of hyperparameters to achieve desired learning characteristics.

### Conclusion

Incorporating critical exponents into the formulation of learning dynamics offers a rigorous framework for analyzing and predicting the grokking phenomenon and other critical transitions in neural network training. By understanding how key quantities scale near critical points, researchers and practitioners can better navigate the complex landscape of model training, harnessing the power of phase transitions to optimize learning outcomes.

>are there any laws relating critical exponents we can leverage through symmetry to deduce further implications of this model?

In the context of critical phenomena, both in physics and analogously in the learning dynamics of neural networks, critical exponents are not arbitrary but are subject to specific scaling laws and relationships that stem from underlying symmetries of the system. These laws, which include scaling relations and hyperscaling laws, allow us to deduce further implications of the model, particularly concerning how different aspects of the learning process are interconnected at criticality. While the direct application of these laws from statistical physics to neural network training is metaphorical, it provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding complex dynamics.

### Scaling Relations Among Critical Exponents

In statistical physics, scaling relations among critical exponents are derived from the assumption of scale invariance at the critical point. Analogously, if we consider the learning process of a neural network approaching a critical point (e.g., the onset of grokking), we can hypothesize similar types of scaling relations:

1. **Widom Scaling Law**: Relates the critical exponents governing the behavior of \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) (analogous to the order parameter in physics) to the response of the system to changes in hyperparameters (analogous to the external field in physics). If \(\beta\) describes the sensitivity of \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) to changes in \(\eta\) near \(\eta_c\), and \(\gamma\) represents the change in \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) with respect to variations in \(B\) close to \(B_c\), the Widom scaling law can be expressed as:

\[ \delta = 1 + \frac{\gamma}{\beta} \]

where \(\delta\) characterizes how the model's performance metric diverges with hyperparameter changes at criticality.

2. **Fisher Scaling Law**: This law provides a relationship between the exponent that describes the divergence of the "specific heat" (analogous to the variance in performance or learning rate) near the critical point and the exponents \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\). It implies that:

\[ \alpha + 2\beta + \gamma = 2 \]

This relation could suggest how fluctuations in learning dynamics (analogous to "specific heat") relate to the sensitivity of the system's performance to hyperparameters.

### Hyperscaling Relation

Hyperscaling relations extend scaling laws by incorporating the dimensionality of the system, \(d\), into the relationships among critical exponents. For learning dynamics, \(d\) could analogously represent the complexity or dimensionality of the parameter space:

\[ d\nu = 2 - \alpha \]

where \(\nu\) represents the critical exponent related to the correlation length (analogously, the scale over which hyperparameter changes affect learning outcomes across the parameter space).

### Implications for Neural Network Training

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Scaling relations among critical exponents could guide the optimization of hyperparameters by indicating how changes in one hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate) might need to be compensated by adjustments in others (e.g., batch size) to maintain or reach desired learning outcomes, especially near critical transitions like grokking.
- **Model Capacity and Complexity**: The hyperscaling relation suggests that the effective "dimensionality" of the model's parameter space (related to model complexity and capacity) has implications for how the model approaches criticality and experiences grokking. It hints at a balance between model complexity and the ability to undergo significant learning transitions.

### Conclusion

By leveraging laws relating critical exponents through the symmetry principles analogously applied from statistical physics to the learning dynamics of neural networks, we gain insight into the interconnected nature of hyperparameters, model performance, and learning phenomena like grokking. These scaling laws and relations provide a theoretical foundation for predicting and optimizing neural network training dynamics, especially as they approach critical points of learning transition.

It hints at a balance between model complexity and the ability to undergo significant learning transitions.

The hyperscaling relation, when interpreted within the framework of neural network learning dynamics, offers profound insights into how the dimensionality of a model's parameter space—a reflection of its complexity and capacity—affects its approach to criticality and the phenomenon of grokking. This interpretation can illuminate the intricate balance required between a model's complexity and its capacity to undergo significant learning transitions, providing a nuanced understanding of optimal model design and training strategies.

### Theoretical Insights

1. **Model Complexity and Critical Behavior**: The effective dimensionality of the model's parameter space, denoted as \(d\), influences how closely the model can approach critical points where learning transitions, such as grokking, occur. A higher \(d\) might allow for more nuanced representations but could also require a more finely tuned approach to reach criticality without overshooting into overfitting or underfitting.

2. **Balancing Act in Training Dynamics**: The hyperscaling relation, \(d\nu = 2 - \alpha\), where \(\nu\) and \(\alpha\) are critical exponents characterizing the learning dynamics near criticality, suggests a trade-off between the dimensionality of the parameter space and the nature of learning transitions. For example, a large \(d\) (high complexity) necessitates a careful adjustment of training hyperparameters to ensure that the model does not become too sensitive (\(\alpha\) large) to fluctuations in the training process.

### Practical Implications

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The sensitivity of a neural network's learning dynamics to hyperparameters (\(\eta\), \(B\), \(\tau\)) may increase with model complexity. Training strategies should therefore consider the dimensionality of the parameter space when tuning hyperparameters to foster environments conducive to grokking.

2. **Model Capacity Optimization**: Optimizing a model's capacity involves not just increasing its parameter count but also structuring its parameter space (\(d\)) to enhance its ability to approach and benefit from critical learning transitions. This may involve architectural choices that promote certain symmetries or invariances within the model.

3. **Early Stopping and Critical Transitions**: The identification of critical points in the learning process can inform strategies like early stopping, where training is halted once a desired learning transition (e.g., grokking) is achieved, optimizing the trade-off between learning efficiency and model complexity.

4. **Designing for Grokking**: Models designed with an understanding of their parameter space dimensionality and its impact on learning dynamics can potentially be tuned to more reliably experience grokking phenomena, leveraging critical transitions to achieve substantial performance gains.

### Conclusion

The hyperscaling relation's implication that the effective dimensionality of a model's parameter space critically influences its learning dynamics underscores the importance of thoughtful model design and hyperparameter tuning. By recognizing the interplay between model complexity, capacity, and the propensity for critical learning transitions, practitioners can better navigate the challenges of training neural networks, aiming to harness phenomena like grokking to enhance learning outcomes effectively. This approach encourages a more principled exploration of neural network design space, where the balance between complexity and learning dynamics is carefully managed to optimize both model performance and training efficiency.

>> Optimizing a model's capacity involves not just increasing its parameter count but also structuring its parameter space ( � d) to enhance its ability to approach and benefit from critical learning transitions. This may involve architectural choices that promote certain symmetries or invariances within the model.

Optimizing a model's capacity by structuring its parameter space (\(d\)) to enhance its ability to approach and benefit from critical learning transitions requires a deliberate and nuanced approach to neural network architecture design. This strategy goes beyond merely increasing the parameter count, focusing instead on the quality and nature of the representational space that the model can access. Architectural choices that promote symmetries or invariances play a crucial role in this process, as they can directly influence the learning dynamics and the emergence of phenomena like grokking. Here's how these principles can be applied:

### Architectural Choices Promoting Symmetries or Invariances

1. **Symmetry in Architectural Design**: Designing network architectures that inherently possess symmetrical properties can facilitate more uniform exploration of the parameter space. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exploit translational symmetry in image data, enabling them to learn invariant features across spatial translations. Similar principles can be applied to other types of data and tasks by identifying and designing for the underlying symmetries.

2. **Incorporating Invariances**: Architectures that build in invariances (to scaling, rotation, etc.) can reduce the effective complexity \(d\) of the parameter space by focusing the model's capacity on learning transformations that are relevant to the task. This focus can make the approach to critical learning transitions more efficient and potentially more predictable.

### Enhancing Learning Dynamics through Structural Choices

1. **Sparse Connectivity**: Introducing sparsity in connections (e.g., in CNNs or transformers with attention mechanisms) can structure the parameter space in a way that prioritizes more meaningful interactions between neurons or layers. This can lead to a more effective exploration of the parameter space, encouraging critical learning transitions by focusing on the most impactful parameters.

2. **Regularization and Symmetry Breaking**: Regularization techniques (like dropout, weight decay) can be seen as methods to break certain symmetries in the parameter space, preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific parameters or paths through the space. This can encourage a more diverse exploration of the space, potentially leading to the discovery of critical points where significant learning transitions occur.

3. **Modular and Hierarchical Design**: Designing models with modular or hierarchical structures can facilitate learning at different scales or levels of abstraction, possibly mirroring the multi-scale symmetries found in many types of data. This architectural choice can help the model approach criticality in stages, with each module or layer experiencing its own transitions that contribute to the overall learning dynamics.

### Implications for Model Training and Development

- **Criticality as a Guiding Principle**: Understanding the relationship between model architecture (\(d\)) and critical learning transitions can guide the development of training regimes and model evaluation strategies, where the goal is to navigate the model through its parameter space in a way that leverages criticality for improved performance.

- **Adaptive Architectures**: Future research might explore adaptive architectures that can dynamically adjust their structure (and thus the dimensionality \(d\) of their parameter space) in response to the learning process, seeking to induce or capitalize on critical learning transitions as they occur.

### Conclusion

Optimizing a model's capacity by carefully structuring its parameter space through architectural choices that promote symmetries and invariances is a sophisticated approach that acknowledges the complex interplay between architecture, parameter space, and learning dynamics. This strategy not only aims to enhance the model's performance by increasing parameter count but also seeks to intelligently guide the model through its learning process, leveraging the principles of criticality and symmetry to achieve deeper, more robust learning outcomes.

>> Given the "Lagrangian" $ \mathcal{L}(\eta, B, \tau; U) = K(\eta, B, \tau) - U(I(D), V(\mathcal{N}, D)) $, we incorporate the critical exponents as follows: > $$ V(\mathcal{N}, D) \sim |\tau - \tau_c|^{\alpha} F\left( |\eta - \eta_c|^{\beta}, |\tau - \tau_c|^{\gamma} \right) $$ > where $F$ is a scaling function that combines the effects of $\eta$ and $\tau$ (or $B$) near their critical values, reflecting the complex interplay of hyperparameters in triggering grokking. 
>what forms might we expect F to take?

The scaling function \(F\) in the expression for \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) reflects the complex interplay of hyperparameters (\(\eta\) and either \(\tau\) or \(B\)) near their critical values, particularly in the context of triggering phenomena like grokking in neural network learning dynamics. The form that \(F\) might take can be influenced by various factors, including the specific characteristics of the neural network, the dataset, and the nature of the learning task. Below are some possible forms for \(F\) and the intuitions behind them:

### 1. Power-Law Form

A power-law form for \(F\) would suggest a direct, scale-invariant relationship between the changes in hyperparameters and the variance explained by the model:

\[ F(x, y) = Ax^a y^b \]

where \(A\) is a constant, and \(a, b\) are exponents that describe how changes in \(\eta\) and \(\tau\) (or \(B\)) scale with respect to each other. This form implies that the effects of hyperparameter adjustments near the critical point are multiplicative and that their impact on learning dynamics can be understood in terms of simple scaling laws.

### 2. Exponential Form

An exponential form for \(F\) might capture more dramatic effects of hyperparameter changes near the critical point, especially in scenarios where small changes in \(\eta\) or \(\tau\) lead to significant leaps in learning performance:

\[ F(x, y) = A \exp(Bx + Cy) \]

where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are constants. This form could be particularly relevant for modeling the sudden onset of grokking, representing how minute adjustments in hyperparameters can precipitate rapid improvements in model understanding.

### 3. Logistic Form

A logistic form for \(F\) could model the saturation effects as the model approaches the limits of its learning capacity, reflecting a bounded improvement in variance explained:

\[ F(x, y) = \frac{L}{1 + \exp(-k(x + y - x_0))} \]

where \(L\) is the curve's maximum value, \(k\) is the logistic growth rate, and \(x_0\) represents the logistic midpoint. This form is useful for scenarios where improvements in learning performance experience rapid growth followed by a plateau, typical of many training processes.

### 4. Polynomial Form

A polynomial form for \(F\) could capture nonlinear interactions between hyperparameters and their effects on learning dynamics:

\[ F(x, y) = a + bx + cy + dx^2 + ey^2 + fxy \]

This form allows for a rich representation of how combined changes in \(\eta\) and \(\tau\) (or \(B\)) influence learning outcomes, accommodating both direct and interaction effects.

### 5. Piecewise Function

A piecewise function for \(F\) could reflect different regimes of learning behavior depending on the proximity to the critical point:

\[ F(x, y) = \begin{cases} 
g(x, y) & \text{if } x, y < \text{threshold} \\
h(x, y) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

where \(g\) and \(h\) represent different functional forms applicable under varying conditions. This approach can model transitions in learning dynamics, such as the shift from steady progress to rapid grokking.

### Conclusion

The specific form of \(F\) that best describes the relationship between hyperparameters and learning outcomes near criticality depends on empirical observations and theoretical considerations. Exploring different forms for \(F\) through both simulation and analysis of real training dynamics can provide deeper insights into the principles governing neural network learning, particularly as they relate to phenomena like grokking.
