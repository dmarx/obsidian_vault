The [[action]], $S$, is a [[functional]], which means it takes a function (the system's path through its configuration space) as input and returns a scalar. It is defined as the [[integral]] over time of the [[Lagrangian]], $L$, of the system:

$$
S[q] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q(t), \dot{q}(t), t) \, dt
$$

Here, $q(t)$ represents the generalized coordinates of the system (which can be positions, angles, or field values), $\dot{q}(t)$ are their time derivatives, and $L$ is the difference between the kinetic and potential energies for classical systems.
