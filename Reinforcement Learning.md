### Reinforcement Learning Overview

In RL, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent's goal is to maximize some notion of cumulative reward over time. Two key components in this process are:

1. **Reward:** A signal from the environment that indicates the immediate benefit of taking a certain action in a particular state. It guides the agent on what is good or bad in the short term.
2. **Policy (Ï€):** A strategy used by the agent, defining the action to take in each state. A policy can be deterministic, where it specifies a single action for each state, or stochastic, where it provides a probability distribution over actions for each state.

### Geometric Perspectives on Reinforcement Learning
