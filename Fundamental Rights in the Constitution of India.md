### Legal and Institutional Framework

3. **Amendments**:
   - Fundamental rights can be amended by the Parliament, but such amendments must not alter the basic structure of the Constitution, as established by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973).

### Case Law and Examples

#### Example 2: **Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)**
   - **Context**: The Supreme Court expanded the interpretation of Article 21, ruling that the right to life and personal liberty includes a wide range of rights such as the right to travel abroad, emphasizing due process.
   - **Significance**: This judgment broadened the scope of Article 21, significantly enhancing the protection of individual liberties.

#### Example 3: **Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997)**
   - **Context**: The Supreme Court laid down guidelines to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace, using the power to enforce fundamental rights.
   - **Significance**: This case underscored the role of the judiciary in filling legislative gaps to protect fundamental rights, particularly under Articles 14, 19, and 21.
