### Cognitive Evaluation Theory

**Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)** is a sub-theory within the broader framework of [[Self-Determination Theory]] (SDT) developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. CET explains the impact of external factors, such as rewards, feedback, and evaluations, on intrinsic motivation. It posits that these factors influence motivation through their effect on an individual's sense of autonomy and competence.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Cognitive Evaluation Theory posits that external factors can either enhance or undermine intrinsic motivation based on how they affect perceptions of autonomy (self-determination) and competence (effectiveness).

2. **Intrinsic Motivation**:
   - **Autonomy**: The need to feel in control of one's own actions and decisions.
   - **Competence**: The need to feel effective and capable in interacting with the environment.

3. **Mechanisms**:
   - **Informational Aspects**: External factors that provide positive feedback about competence can enhance intrinsic motivation by affirming the individual's sense of effectiveness.
   - **Controlling Aspects**: External factors perceived as controlling or coercive can undermine intrinsic motivation by diminishing the individual's sense of autonomy.
   - **Amotivating Aspects**: External factors that convey incompetence or lack of control can lead to amotivation, where individuals feel neither intrinsically nor extrinsically motivated.

#### Theoretical Framework

1. **Effect on Autonomy**:
   - **Support for Autonomy**: Actions that support an individual's autonomy (e.g., providing choices, encouraging self-initiation) enhance intrinsic motivation.
   - **Control and Pressure**: Actions that pressure or control behavior (e.g., deadlines, surveillance, contingent rewards) undermine intrinsic motivation by reducing the sense of autonomy.

2. **Effect on Competence**:
   - **Positive Feedback**: Informational feedback that affirms competence (e.g., praise, skill development) enhances intrinsic motivation.
   - **Negative Feedback**: Feedback that highlights failures or inadequacies can diminish intrinsic motivation by reducing the sense of competence.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Deci (1971) Study**:
   - **Experiment**: College students were either paid or not paid to complete a puzzle they initially enjoyed. The paid group showed decreased intrinsic motivation once payments stopped, compared to the unpaid group.
   - **Results**: Monetary rewards, when perceived as controlling, undermined intrinsic motivation.

2. **Ryan, Mims, and Koestner (1983)**:
   - **Experiment**: Participants were given either positive feedback, no feedback, or negative feedback while performing a task.
   - **Results**: Positive feedback enhanced intrinsic motivation, while negative feedback decreased it, illustrating the importance of perceived competence.

3. **Flink, Boggiano, and Barrett (1990)**:
   - **Experiment**: Children were given tasks with either autonomy-supportive or controlling instructions.
   - **Results**: Autonomy-supportive instructions enhanced intrinsic motivation, whereas controlling instructions undermined it.

#### Mathematical Formalization

To formalize CET, consider the following utility model of motivation:

1. **Intrinsic Motivation ($M_i$)**:
   - Let $M_i$ represent the intrinsic motivation derived from the sense of autonomy ($A$) and competence ($C$):
   $$
   M_i = f(A, C)
   $$

2. **Effects of External Factors**:
   - Let $E$ represent an external factor that has both controlling ($E_c$) and informational ($E_i$) components. The perceived autonomy ($A'$) and competence ($C'$) can be expressed as:
   $$
   A' = A - g(E_c)
   $$
   $$
   C' = C + h(E_i)
   $$
   where $g$ and $h$ are functions capturing the influence of the controlling and informational aspects, respectively.

3. **Total Motivation ($M_t$)**:
   - The total motivation considering the external factors is:
   $$
   M_t = f(A', C')
   $$

   - If $E$ is perceived as controlling (high $E_c$), $A'$ decreases, leading to reduced $M_t$. If $E$ provides positive informational feedback (high $E_i$), $C'$ increases, enhancing $M_t$.

#### Implications

1. **Educational Settings**:
   - **Teaching Practices**: Educators should focus on supporting students' autonomy and providing constructive feedback to enhance intrinsic motivation.

2. **Workplace Environment**:
   - **Management Practices**: Employers should avoid overly controlling practices and instead foster autonomy and competence through supportive supervision and recognition of achievements.

3. **Parenting and Coaching**:
   - **Supportive Approach**: Parents and coaches should emphasize autonomy-supportive behaviors and positive feedback to cultivate intrinsic motivation in children and athletes.
