A semigroup is a basic algebraic structure that captures the essence of associativity in binary operations. It's a foundational concept in abstract algebra and has important applications across mathematics, including in analysis, topology, and the theory of computation. Understanding semigroups helps in studying more complex structures like [[Groups]], [[rings]], and [[fields]].

### Definition

Formally, a semigroup $(S, \cdot)$ consists of a set $S$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot : S \times S \rightarrow S$ that satisfies the following property:

- **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c \in S$, the equation $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ holds.

Note that unlike a group, a semigroup does not require the existence of an identity element or inverses for its elements.

### Examples

1. **Natural numbers under addition:** The set $\mathbb{N}$ (including 0) with the operation of addition is a semigroup because addition is associative.
2. **Matrix multiplication:** The set of all $n \times n$ matrices over a field (or ring) with the operation of matrix multiplication forms a semigroup. Matrix multiplication is associative but not all matrices have inverses.
3. **Strings under concatenation:** Given a set of characters, the set of all finite strings formed from these characters, including the empty string, under the operation of concatenation, is a semigroup. This example is particularly notable in computer science, especially in the theory of formal languages.

### Properties

- **Identity and Subsemigroups:** If a semigroup has an element that acts as an identity element (meaning $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$ for all $a \in S$), it is called a monoid. A subset of a semigroup that is itself a semigroup under the same operation is known as a subsemigroup.
- **Commutativity:** A semigroup is called commutative or abelian if its operation is commutative ($a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in S$).

### Importance and Applications

- **Algebraic Structures:** Semigroups provide insight into the more general behavior of algebraic operations and serve as the stepping stones towards understanding more complex structures like groups and monoids.
- **Functional Analysis:** In functional analysis, semigroups of operators are used to solve differential equations and to model dynamical systems.
- **Computer Science:** Semigroups appear in the study of automata and formal languages, where the concatenation of strings or paths in a graph follows semigroup properties.
- **Topology:** Semigroups are used in topological dynamics and the study of continuous transformation semigroups, providing tools for understanding the behavior of dynamical systems over time.

Semigroup theory thus serves as a foundational area of mathematics with deep theoretical significance and wide-ranging applications across disciplines.
