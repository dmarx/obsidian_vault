Surface tension is a [[Fundamental Physical Phenomena|fundamental physical phenomenon]] that occurs at the [[Interface Phenomena|interface]] between two different phases, most commonly observed at liquid-gas interfaces. It manifests as an elastic-like force on the surface of the liquid that makes it behave as if it were covered by an invisible stretched membrane. This phenomenon is due to the cohesive forces among liquid molecules, which are stronger within the liquid than between the liquid and the gas, leading to a net inward force that [[Minimal Surfaces|minimizes the surface area]] of the liquid.

### Mathematical Description

Surface tension, denoted as $\gamma$ or $\sigma$, is defined as the force per unit length exerted parallel to the surface of the liquid or as the energy required to increase the surface area of the liquid by a unit area. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$\gamma = \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial A}\right)_{T,V,N} = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial A}\right)_{T,V,N}$$

where:
- $F$ is the [[Helmholtz free energy]],
- $U$ is the internal energy of the system,
- $A$ is the surface area,
- $T$ is the temperature,
- $V$ is the volume, and
- $N$ is the number of particles in the system.

This definition highlights that surface tension can also be viewed as a measure of the energy change associated with an increase in surface area, emphasizing its role as a surface property.

### Physical Effects and Phenomena

1. **Capillarity (Capillary Action):** Surface tension allows liquids to flow against gravity in narrow spaces, such as in the capillaries of plants or in thin tubes. This effect is described by the [[Young-Laplace equation]], which relates the curvature of the liquid surface to the pressure difference across it.

2. **Drops and Bubbles:** The spherical shape of liquid drops and [[soap bubbles]] is due to surface tension minimizing the surface area for a given volume, as a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a volume.

3. **Wetting and [[Contact Angle]]:** Surface tension influences the wetting behavior of liquids on solids, characterized by the contact angle. The balance of adhesive (liquid-solid) and cohesive (liquid-liquid) forces determines whether a liquid spreads out over a surface or forms droplets.

4. **[[Surfactants]]:** Substances that reduce surface tension, known as surfactants, are key in many applications, including detergents, emulsions, and foams. They work by adsorbing at the liquid-gas interface and disrupting the cohesive forces among liquid molecules.

### Measurement Techniques

Several methods are used to measure surface tension, including:

- **Wilhelmy Plate Method:** A plate is dipped into the liquid, and the force required to detach it is measured.
- **Du No√ºy Ring Method:** A ring, usually made of platinum, is submerged in the liquid, and the force needed to lift it from the surface is measured.
- **Capillary Rise Method:** The height to which a liquid climbs by capillary action in a thin tube is related to its surface tension.
- **Drop Weight/Volume Method:** The weight or volume of a drop that falls from a capillary tube is used to calculate the surface tension.

### Applications

Surface tension is exploited in numerous scientific, industrial, and everyday applications:

- **Inkjet Printing:** The formation and ejection of ink droplets are controlled by manipulating surface tension.
- **Medical Devices:** Surface tension is critical in the design of devices that manipulate biological fluids, such as in microfluidic chips.
- **Material Science:** The fabrication of nanomaterials and coatings often requires precise control of surface tension to achieve desired properties.
- **Environmental Science:** The study of surface tension is important in understanding the spreading and dispersion of pollutants in water bodies.

Understanding surface tension is crucial for the analysis and design of systems and processes in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering, providing insights into the behavior of liquids and their interaction with other phases.
