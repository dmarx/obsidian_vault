A metric or distance function $d$ on a set $X$ satisfies the following properties for any elements $a, b, c \in X$:

1. **Non-negativity**: $d(a, b) \geq 0$ and $d(a, b) = 0$ if and only if $a = b$.
2. **[[Symmetry]]**: $d(a, b) = d(b, a)$.
3. **[[Triangle Inequality]]**: $d(a, c) \leq d(a, b) + d(b, c)$.

These properties ensure that a metric provides a consistent and intuitive measure of distance within the space it is defined.
