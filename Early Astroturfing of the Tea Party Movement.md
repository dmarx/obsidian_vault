The Tea Party movement, which emerged in early 2009, was ostensibly a grassroots political movement advocating for lower taxes, reduced government spending, and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. However, there was significant evidence of astroturfing by powerful interest groups that sought to shape the movement's agenda and amplify its impact. This early astroturfing played a crucial role in the rapid growth and influence of the Tea Party.
