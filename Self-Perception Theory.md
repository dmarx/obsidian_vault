### Self-Perception Theory

**Self-perception theory** is a psychological theory developed by Daryl Bem in 1972. It posits that individuals form their attitudes and beliefs by observing their own behavior and the context in which this behavior occurs, rather than through introspection or the direct assessment of internal states. This theory contrasts with traditional views that attitudes and beliefs precede and guide behavior.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Self-perception theory suggests that people infer their own attitudes and beliefs by observing their behavior and considering the situational context, much like an external observer would.

2. **Mechanisms**:
   - **Behavior Observation**: When internal cues (e.g., feelings, prior attitudes) are weak or ambiguous, individuals rely on their behavior to infer their attitudes.
   - **Situational Context**: The context in which behavior occurs is crucial; people consider whether their actions were freely chosen or externally motivated (e.g., rewards, social pressure).

3. **Comparison with Cognitive Dissonance**:
   - **[[Cognitive Dissonance Theory]]** (Festinger, 1957): Proposes that inconsistent cognitions cause psychological discomfort, which individuals strive to reduce by changing their attitudes or behavior.
   - **Self-Perception Theory**: Suggests that people derive attitudes from their behavior without necessarily experiencing dissonance, especially when the internal state is unclear.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Bem’s Classic Studies**:
   - **Forced Compliance Paradigm**: Bem reinterpreted classic dissonance experiments (e.g., Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959), suggesting that participants inferred their enjoyment of a boring task by observing their compliance and the situational justification (e.g., $1 or $20).

2. **[[Facial Feedback Hypothesis]]**:
   - **Strack, Martin, & Stepper (1988)**: Participants who were instructed to hold a pen between their teeth (inducing a smile) rated cartoons as funnier than those holding the pen with their lips (inducing a frown), inferring their enjoyment from their facial expression.

3. **[[Overjustification Effect]]**:
   - **Lepper, Greene, & Nisbett (1973)**: Children who were rewarded for playing with markers subsequently played with them less than those who weren’t rewarded, suggesting they inferred their previous enjoyment was due to the reward, not intrinsic interest.

#### Mathematical Formalization

To formalize self-perception theory, consider a model where an individual observes their behavior $B$ and the context $C$ to infer their attitude $A$:

1. **Behavioral Observation**:
   Let $B$ represent the observed behavior, and $C$ represent the contextual factors (e.g., external rewards, social pressures).

2. **Inference Process**:
   The perceived attitude $\hat{A}$ is inferred from $B$ and $C$ using a function $f$:
   $$
   \hat{A} = f(B, C)
   $$
   This function $f$ accounts for the likelihood that the behavior is self-determined versus externally motivated.

3. **Bayesian Inference Framework**:
   In a Bayesian framework, the probability of an attitude $A$ given behavior $B$ and context $C$ can be expressed as:
   $$
   P(A \mid B, C) \propto P(B \mid A, C) \cdot P(A)
   $$
   where $P(B \mid A, C)$ is the likelihood of observing behavior $B$ given attitude $A$ and context $C$, and $P(A)$ is the prior probability of attitude $A$.

#### Implications

Understanding self-perception theory has several implications:

1. **Behavioral Change**:
   - **Interventions**: Encouraging desirable behaviors can lead to attitude changes as individuals infer their attitudes from their actions (e.g., promoting recycling by making it easy and rewarding).

2. **Therapeutic Applications**:
   - **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Therapists can use behavior-based interventions to help clients infer more adaptive attitudes and beliefs from their positive actions.

3. **Social and Organizational Behavior**:
   - **Employee Motivation**: Recognizing that external rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation (overjustification effect), organizations might focus on fostering intrinsic motivation through meaningful work and recognition.
