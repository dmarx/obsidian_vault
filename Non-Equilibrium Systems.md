Nonequilibrium systems are an extensive field of study within physics and applied mathematics, touching on a broad array of phenomena where the system under consideration is not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. These systems are characterized by changes over time, where the detailed balance typically seen in [[equilibrium states]]—where macroscopic properties remain constant—is absent. Instead, these systems exhibit dynamic behavior, including steady states, oscillations, and [[chaotic dynamics]], often driven by external forces or internal fluxes of energy and matter.

### Fundamental Concepts

- **Thermodynamic Equilibrium vs. Nonequilibrium**: A system is in thermodynamic [[equilibrium]] if it meets the criteria of [[mechanical equilibrium]] (no macroscopic mechanical changes), [[thermal equilibrium]] (uniform temperature), and [[chemical equilibrium]] (no net change in chemical composition). In contrast, nonequilibrium systems do not satisfy these conditions, often exhibiting spatial and temporal variations in properties such as temperature, pressure, and chemical concentration.

- **[[Steady States]]**: Unlike equilibrium states, which are characterized by the minimization of a potential (like free energy), nonequilibrium steady states maintain constant macroscopic properties over time without implying the absence of microscopic changes. Energy or material fluxes are balanced so that the system's overall state remains consistent, though it is not at rest.

- **Fluxes and Forces**: [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics]] often involves the study of fluxes (of energy, particles, etc.) and the forces driving them. The relationship between fluxes and forces can be linear (as in [[near-equilibrium systems]], described by [[Onsager's reciprocal relations]]) or highly nonlinear in [[far-from-equilibrium systems|far-from-equilibrium]] conditions.

### Examples of Nonequilibrium Systems

1. **Living Organisms**: Biological systems operate far from equilibrium, continuously exchanging matter and energy with their environment to maintain life processes.
   
2. **Climate Systems**: The Earth's climate system is driven out of equilibrium by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface, leading to complex patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation.

3. **[[Chemical Reactions]]**: Chemical reaction networks, especially those far from equilibrium, can exhibit complex behavior, including oscillations (as seen in the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]]) and [[pattern formation]].

4. **Economic and Social Systems**: Systems of agents interacting in economic and social contexts can be modeled as nonequilibrium systems, where exchanges of goods, information, or influence drive the system's dynamics.

### Mathematical and Theoretical Frameworks

- **[[Dynamical Systems Theory]]**: Provides tools for analyzing the stability and behavior of systems over time, including [[fixed points]], [[limit cycles]], and [[chaotic attractors]].

- **[[Statistical Mechanics]]**: Extensions of statistical mechanics to nonequilibrium systems aim to understand the microscopic underpinnings of macroscopic behavior, including the development of nonequilibrium ensembles and fluctuation theorems.

- **[[Stochastic Processes]]**: Many nonequilibrium phenomena are inherently stochastic, necessitating the use of [[stochastic differential equations]], [[master equations]], and [[Monte Carlo simulations]] for their analysis.

- **[[Complex Systems]] and [[Network Theory]]**: The study of [[complex networks]] and their behavior is essential for understanding the [[Emergence|emergent properties]] of [[interconnected nonequilibrium systems]], such as ecosystems, neural networks, and social networks.

### Challenges and Open Questions

Studying nonequilibrium systems poses significant challenges, as the lack of a universal principle like the minimization of free energy in equilibrium makes the generalization of results difficult. Key open questions involve the extension of thermodynamic concepts to far-from-equilibrium conditions, the characterization of transient states, and the prediction of system behavior in highly interconnected and adaptive systems.

The exploration of nonequilibrium systems bridges traditional disciplines, drawing insights from physics, chemistry, biology, and beyond, to understand the principles governing dynamic and complex phenomena. This research not only enhances our theoretical knowledge but also has practical implications in designing materials, understanding biological systems, and tackling environmental challenges.
