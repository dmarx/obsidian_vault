### Positive Psychology

**Positive Psychology** is a branch of psychology that focuses on the study and promotion of positive aspects of human life, such as happiness, well-being, and flourishing. It seeks to understand and enhance the factors that contribute to a fulfilling and meaningful life.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Positive psychology is the scientific study of positive human functioning and flourishing on multiple levels, including the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life.

2. **Foundations**:
   - **Historical Background**: While psychology has traditionally focused on mental illness and dysfunction, positive psychology emerged as a distinct field in the late 1990s, led by psychologists like Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.
   - **Key Figures**: Martin Seligman, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Barbara Fredrickson, and others have contributed foundational theories and research in positive psychology.

3. **Core Concepts**:
   - **Positive Emotions**: Emotions such as joy, gratitude, and love that enhance well-being and life satisfaction.
   - **Engagement**: Being deeply involved and absorbed in activities, often referred to as "flow."

   - **Meaning**: Having a sense of purpose and significance in life.
   - **Accomplishment**: Pursuing and achieving goals that provide a sense of competence and success.

4. **Theoretical Frameworks**:
   - **[[PERMA Model]]**: Martin Seligman's model outlining five key elements of well-being: Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment.
   - **[[Broaden-and-Build Theory]]**: Barbara Fredrickson's theory suggesting that positive emotions broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Broaden-and-Build Theory**:
   - Positive emotions expand cognitive and behavioral capacities, leading to the building of enduring personal resources, such as social connections, skills, and resilience.

2. **[[Flow Theory]]**:
   - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow describes a state of deep engagement and immersion in activities that are challenging yet matched to one's skills, resulting in high satisfaction and productivity.

3. **[[Gratitude]]**:
   - Practicing gratitude enhances well-being by promoting positive emotions, fostering social bonds, and reducing negative emotions.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Seligman, Steen, Park, and Peterson (2005)**:
   - **Study**: Examined the effects of positive psychology interventions on happiness and depression.
   - **Findings**: Positive interventions, such as practicing gratitude and identifying personal strengths, significantly increased happiness and reduced depressive symptoms.
