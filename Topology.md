In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **topology** (from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") words [τόπος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:τόπος"), 'place, location', and λόγος, 'study') is concerned with the properties of a [geometric object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") that are preserved under [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") [deformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_theory "Deformation theory"), such as [stretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretch_factor "Stretch factor"), [twisting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_(mathematics) "Twist (mathematics)"), crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself.

### Topology of Manifolds
[[Topology]], on the other hand, is concerned with the properties of space that are [[Conservation Laws|preserved]] under [[Continuity|continuous]] deformations, such as stretching, crumpling, and bending, but not tearing or gluing. It deals with concepts like continuity, [[compactness]], and [[connectivity]]. Topological properties are global in nature, as they describe features of the entire space rather than local geometric details.
