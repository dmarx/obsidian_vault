Algebraic varieties are central objects of study in [[algebraic geometry]], a branch of mathematics that bridges algebra with geometry. An algebraic variety can be thought of as a geometric manifestation of solutions to systems of polynomial equations. These objects encapsulate both the shape and the algebraic structure of these solutions, providing a rich framework for exploring a wide range of mathematical phenomena.

### Definition

Formally, an algebraic variety over a [[field]] $K$ (often $\mathbb{C}$, the field of [[complex numbers]], or $\mathbb{R}$, the field of [[real numbers]]) is defined as the set of points in $K^n$ that satisfy a given set of polynomial equations:

$$
f_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = 0, \ldots, f_m(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = 0
$$

where each $f_i$ is a polynomial in $n$ variables with coefficients in $K$.

### Types of Varieties

- **[[Affine Varieties]]**: The set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations in [[affine space]] (think of the usual Euclidean space, but extended to accommodate algebraic structures). These are the "basic building blocks" of algebraic geometry.

- **[[Projective Varieties]]**: These are defined similarly to affine varieties but within [[projective space]], which adds "points at infinity" to account for limits of parallel lines intersecting. Projective varieties are crucial for understanding geometric properties that are invariant under [[perspective transformations]].

- **[[Quasi-projective Varieties]]**: Any open subset (in the [[Zariski topology]]) of a projective variety. These encompass both affine and projective varieties and provide flexibility in studying the geometric properties of varieties.

### Key Concepts

- **[[Zariski Topology]]**: A topology on the set of points of an algebraic variety where closed sets are defined to be the zero sets of collections of polynomials. This topology is coarser than the usual [[Euclidean topology]] and is adapted to the algebraic structure of varieties.

- **Dimension**: The dimension of an algebraic variety is a fundamental [[Invariants|invariant]] that measures its "size" in a geometric-algebraic sense. It can be defined in several equivalent ways, including as the maximum length of chains of subvarieties.

- **[[Singularities]]**: Points on a variety where the geometric structure "fails" to be [[Regularity|regular]], such as points of self-intersection or cusps. Understanding and resolving singularities is a central task in algebraic geometry.

- **[[Morphism]]**: A function between varieties that is given by polynomials. Morphisms are the natural maps in algebraic geometry, preserving the [[algebraic structure]] of varieties.

### Applications and Importance

Algebraic varieties are studied not only for their intrinsic geometric and algebraic interest but also for their applications across mathematics:

- **[[Number Theory]]**: Via the study of varieties over [[finite fields]] or [[number fields]], contributing to major advances such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

- **[[Complex Geometry]]**: Where the interplay between algebraic varieties and [[complex manifolds]] enriches both fields, especially through the study of [[compact Riemann surfaces]] (one-dimensional complex projective varieties).

- **[[Differential Geometry]] and [[Topology]]**: Through the study of algebraic curves (one-dimensional varieties), surfaces (two-dimensional), and their higher-dimensional analogs, contributing to the understanding of curvature, topology, and symmetry.

- **Physics and String Theory**: In the context of the compactification of extra dimensions and the study of moduli spaces of certain algebraic varieties, providing insights into the mathematical underpinnings of physical theories.

Algebraic varieties encapsulate the deep connections between algebra and geometry, offering a window into the complex structures that can arise from simple polynomial equations and playing a crucial role in the development of modern mathematics.
