**Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria**

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards used by investors to evaluate a company’s operations and performance in three key areas: environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices. ESG criteria help investors assess the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in a company, guiding decisions that align with broader values and long-term financial performance.

### Key Components of ESG Criteria

1. **Environmental Criteria**:

     - **Climate Change**: Policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate risks.
     - **Resource Management**: Efficient use of natural resources, including water, energy, and raw materials.
     - **Pollution and Waste**: Management of waste, pollution, and toxic emissions.
     - **Biodiversity and Land Use**: Impact on biodiversity and land use practices, including deforestation and habitat destruction.

2. **Social Criteria**:
   - These criteria evaluate a company’s relationships with its employees, suppliers, customers, and communities. Key considerations include:

### Importance and Benefits of ESG Criteria
