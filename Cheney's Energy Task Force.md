### Cheney's Energy Task Force

**Officially Known As**: National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG)

**Formation and Purpose**: 
In January 2001, shortly after taking office, President George W. Bush established the National Energy Policy Development Group, chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney. The task force was created to develop a national energy policy aimed at addressing energy shortages and outlining the administration's approach to energy production, consumption, and regulation.

### Key Objectives

1. **Increase Domestic Energy Production**:
   - Enhance oil, natural gas, and coal production.
   - Expand nuclear energy capabilities.
   - Promote renewable energy sources as a secondary focus.

2. **Strengthen Energy Infrastructure**:
   - Modernize and expand the U.S. energy infrastructure, including pipelines, power plants, and the electric grid.

3. **Reduce Regulatory Barriers**:
   - Streamline regulations to facilitate quicker development and deployment of energy projects.

4. **Enhance Energy Security**:
   - Reduce dependency on foreign oil by boosting domestic production.
   - Diversify energy sources to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply.

### Controversy and Criticism

1. **Secrecy and Lack of Transparency**:
   - The task force operated with a high level of secrecy, refusing to disclose meeting details, participants, or documents related to its discussions.
   - Several lawsuits, including those by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and environmental groups, sought to force disclosure of the task force's activities and participants. These efforts largely failed to achieve full transparency.

2. **Influence of the Fossil Fuel Industry**:
   - It was widely reported and criticized that the task force included significant input from executives and lobbyists from major oil, gas, and coal companies.
   - Documents later released through litigation and FOIA requests revealed meetings with representatives from ExxonMobil, Conoco, Shell Oil, BP America, and the National Mining Association, among others.

3. **Environmental and Public Health Concerns**:
   - Environmental groups argued that the task force prioritized the interests of the fossil fuel industry over environmental protection and public health.
   - The policy recommendations were criticized for potentially increasing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and the risks associated with fossil fuel extraction and transportation.

### Key Policy Recommendations

1. **Expansion of Fossil Fuel Production**:
   - Open more federal lands and offshore areas for oil and gas drilling.
   - Streamline the permitting process for energy projects.
   - Provide incentives and reduce regulatory barriers for coal mining.

2. **Nuclear Energy Development**:
   - Support the development and licensing of new nuclear power plants.
   - Address issues related to nuclear waste storage and disposal.

3. **Energy Infrastructure**:
   - Encourage investment in energy infrastructure, including pipelines, refineries, and the electric grid.
   - Support the construction of new transmission lines to improve the reliability of the electricity supply.

4. **Energy Efficiency and Renewables**:
   - Promote energy efficiency in federal buildings and operations.
   - Provide limited support for renewable energy sources, primarily through tax credits and research funding.

### Outcomes and Legacy

1. **Energy Policy Act of 2005**:
   - The task force's recommendations influenced the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included measures to promote energy production, infrastructure development, and certain efficiency improvements.
   - The act provided substantial subsidies and incentives for the fossil fuel industry while also supporting nuclear energy and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy.

2. **Criticism and Legal Challenges**:
   - The secrecy and perceived industry bias of the task force led to ongoing criticism and legal challenges.
   - Efforts to obtain full transparency about the task force’s activities continued for years, but full disclosure was never achieved.

3. **Impact on Climate Policy**:
   - The focus on expanding fossil fuel production and reducing regulatory oversight was seen as a setback for climate change mitigation efforts.
   - The task force's policies contributed to increased domestic fossil fuel production, with lasting implications for U.S. energy and environmental policy.

### Key Figures Involved

1. **Dick Cheney**: Vice President and Chair of the NEPDG.
2. **Andrew Lundquist**: Executive Director of the NEPDG, who coordinated the task force's activities and report drafting.
3. **Spencer Abraham**: Secretary of Energy, who played a significant role in shaping and advocating for the policy recommendations.
4. **Christine Todd Whitman**: Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who was involved in discussions on environmental impacts.

### Conclusion

Cheney's Energy Task Force was a pivotal element in shaping the Bush administration's energy policy, emphasizing increased production and infrastructure development, particularly for fossil fuels. The task force's secrecy and the significant influence of industry stakeholders led to considerable controversy and criticism. The policy outcomes, particularly those enshrined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, reflected the administration's priorities and had lasting impacts on U.S. energy policy and environmental regulation.
