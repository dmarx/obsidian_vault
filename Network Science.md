[[Network Science|Network science]] is an interdisciplinary research area that studies the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It applies mathematical [[graph theory]], physics, statistics, and computational techniques to analyze networks in various domains, including [[social networks]], biological networks, technological networks, and more. By exploring the patterns and principles underlying these networks, network science aims to understand how the structure of a network affects its behavior, how information flows within it, and how these networks evolve over time.

### Core Concepts

1. **Nodes and Edges**: The fundamental components of networks are nodes (vertices) and edges (links). Nodes represent entities, such as individuals in a social network or neurons in a neural network, while edges represent the relationships or interactions between these entities.

2. **Degree and Degree Distribution**: The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. The [[degree distribution]] of a network is a probability distribution that represents the fraction of nodes in the network with a given degree. This distribution is crucial for understanding the network's topology and robustness.

3. **Paths and Connectivity**: A path in a network is a sequence of edges that connects a pair of nodes. [[Network connectivity]] describes how nodes are connected to each other, which is essential for analyzing [[network resilience]] and the efficiency of information or material transport.

4. **[[Clustering Coefficient]]**: This metric measures the degree to which nodes in a network tend to cluster together, indicating the presence of tightly knit groups within the network.

5. **[[Network Motifs]]**: Small, recurring patterns of interconnections within a larger network. These motifs are considered the building blocks of complex networks and can reveal fundamental functional properties of the network.

6. **[[Centrality Measures]]**: Various metrics, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, quantify the importance or influence of nodes within a network.

7. **[[Network Dynamics]]**: Studies how networks change over time, including the evolution of their topology, the process of network growth, and the dynamics of processes taking place on the network, such as spreading phenomena.

### Applications of Network Science
