> Symmetry and Symmetry Breaking: Landau theory emphasizes the role of symmetry in phase transitions. A phase transition often involves a change in symmetry, where the more symmetric (disordered) phase breaks into a less symmetric (ordered) phase. This symmetry breaking is characterized by changes in the order parameter.

[[Symmetry]] and symmetry breaking are at the heart of [[Landau Theory]] and are pivotal concepts in understanding phase transitions. These concepts explain how systems change phase, often leading to new physical properties. Here's a deeper look at their significance:

### Symmetry in Physical Systems

In physics, symmetry refers to a system's invariance under certain transformations, such as rotations, translations, or reflections. Symmetries dictate conservation laws and physical properties. For instance, rotational symmetry in a system can imply conservation of angular momentum.

### Symmetry Breaking

Symmetry breaking occurs when a system's state changes in such a way that it no longer exhibits some of its prior symmetries. This is a fundamental mechanism behind phase transitions:

- **Disordered to Ordered Phase**: In the context of phase transitions, a system typically goes from a high-symmetry (disordered) phase to a low-symmetry (ordered) phase. The high-symmetry phase respects more symmetry operations (e.g., any direction in space is equivalent in a disordered magnetic system), while the low-symmetry phase has fewer symmetries (e.g., magnetic moments align in a specific direction).

### Role of the [[Order Parameter]]

The order parameter is a quantity that measures the degree of symmetry breaking. Its value is zero in the symmetric (disordered) phase and non-zero in the broken symmetry (ordered) phase. This change in the order parameter:

- **Identifies the [[Phase Transition]]**: The onset of a non-zero order parameter indicates the system has undergone a phase transition.
- **Describes the New Phase**: The specific value and nature of the order parameter describe the characteristics of the new, less symmetric phase.

### Examples of Symmetry Breaking

- **Magnetic Systems**: In ferromagnetic materials, above the Curie temperature, thermal fluctuations disorder the magnetic moments, and the system is invariant under rotations (rotational symmetry). Below the Curie temperature, the magnetic moments align, breaking rotational symmetry. The magnetization, a vector quantity, serves as the order parameter.

- **Superconductivity**: Superconductors below their critical temperature exhibit a phase where electrical resistance drops to zero. The superconducting phase breaks gauge symmetry, and the complex order parameter associated with Cooper pair condensation describes this phase.

### Implications of Symmetry Breaking

- **Goldstone's Theorem**: In systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking from a continuous symmetry, Goldstone's theorem predicts the existence of massless modes or particles, known as Goldstone bosons. These are crucial in many areas of physics, including particle physics and condensed matter physics.

- **Higgs Mechanism**: In particle physics, the Higgs mechanism is a process by which gauge bosons acquire mass through symmetry breaking. This is a cornerstone of the Standard Model of particle physics, illustrating the broader applicability of symmetry and symmetry breaking concepts.

- **[[Emergence|Emergent]] Phenomena**: Symmetry breaking leads to emergent phenomena, where the macroscopic ordered phase has properties that are not simply deducible from the microscopic laws governing the individual components of the system. This underlies the formation of complex structures and patterns in nature, from crystal lattices to biological organisms.

Symmetry and symmetry breaking, therefore, provide a powerful framework for understanding the diverse and complex behaviors observed in physical systems, especially as they undergo phase transitions.
