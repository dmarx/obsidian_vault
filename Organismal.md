some TBD set of properties.

things that should be members of this set:
* [[Organization As Entity]]
* [[White Blood Cells]]
* [[T-Cells]]
* [[Language]] and maybe also indidividual [[words]]
* [[Ant Colonies]]
* [[Prelude - Ant Fugue]]
* 

I think one of the axes of classification here is in the time dimension, specifically distribution over scale of interaction/bifurcation/'phase transition' duration/length/lifecycle.
