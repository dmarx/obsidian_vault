Laplace's equation is a second-order elliptic PDE used in [[potential theory]], electrostatics, and fluid dynamics, among other fields. It represents stationary (time-independent) solutions where there is no net change in a quantity:

$$ \nabla^2 u = 0 $$

The solutions to Laplace's equation, known as harmonic functions, have no local maxima or minima.
