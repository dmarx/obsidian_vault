### Definition of Excitable Medium

An **excitable medium** is a type of mathematical model used to describe systems that can exhibit [[self-sustaining]] [[wave propagation]] due to a local excitation response. These media are characterized by their ability to propagate a response over a distance far greater than the dimension of the initial disturbance, without an external input. Excitable media are commonly studied in contexts like cardiology, neurology, and chemical reactions, particularly in the study of phenomena such as cardiac arrhythmias, neural wave propagation, and the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]].

### Mathematical Description

The dynamics of an excitable medium can be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the spatial and temporal evolution of state variables. A common model used to describe such a system is the [[FitzHugh-Nagumo model]], a simplification of the [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]] that describes nerve membrane action potentials. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is composed of two equations:

1. **Voltage equation** (describes the electric potential across the membrane):
   $$\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = v - \frac{v^3}{3} - w + D_v \nabla^2 v$$

2. **Recovery equation** (describes the recovery variable, which models processes that restore the system to its rest state):
   $$\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = \epsilon (v + a - bw)$$

Here, $v$ represents the [[membrane potential]], $w$ is a recovery variable, $D_v$ is the diffusion coefficient for the potential, $\nabla^2$ is the [[Laplace Operator|Laplacian operator]] representing diffusion through the medium, and $\epsilon$, $a$, and $b$ are parameters that can be adjusted to fit specific biological or chemical conditions. The terms involving $v^3$ introduce nonlinearity, crucial for the excitability of the medium.

### Properties and Characteristics

- **[[Threshold Dynamics]]**: Excitable media have a threshold property; a small perturbation will decay, while a perturbation exceeding the threshold will initiate a self-propagating wave.
- **[[Refractory Period]]**: After an excitation, the medium enters a refractory period during which its ability to propagate further waves is either reduced or completely inhibited. This prevents the back-propagation of waves and is crucial for the unidirectional flow of signals in neural and cardiac tissues.
- **Wave Propagation**: In two or three dimensions, excitable media can support [[complex wave phenomena]], including [[spiral waves]] or [[target patterns]], which are often observed in both biological and chemical systems.

### Applications

- **Cardiology**: Modeling of cardiac tissue as an excitable medium helps to understand the propagation of electrical waves in the heart and the mechanisms behind arrhythmias.
- **Neuroscience**: Excitable media models are used to study the propagation of action potentials along nerve fibers and across brain structures.
- **Chemical Reactions**: The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, a chemical oscillation of a stirred reaction mixture, is often studied as an excitable medium due to its wave propagation properties.

For a detailed understanding of the mathematical and physical implications of these models, a deeper dive into the FitzHugh-Nagumo model or other related models like the [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]] and [[Reaction-Diffusion Systems|reaction-diffusion systems]] would be beneficial. These models provide a rich framework for exploring the non-linear dynamics characteristic of excitable media.

### Excitatory Medium

An excitatory medium is a type of medium in which local activations or excitations can propagate through the system, often resulting in wave-like phenomena. These activations typically spread due to the medium's properties that allow for the transmission of excitation, which can lead to complex behaviors such as pattern formation, wave propagation, and synchronization.

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Excitability**:
   - **Definition**: The ability of the medium to undergo a temporary and reversible change in state in response to an external stimulus.
   - **Example**: Neurons in the brain exhibit excitability, where an external stimulus can cause a neuron to fire an action potential.

2. **Propagation**:
   - **Definition**: The process by which excitation moves through the medium.
   - **Example**: The propagation of electrical impulses along nerve fibers.

3. **Threshold Dynamics**:
   - **Definition**: The excitation occurs only if the stimulus exceeds a certain threshold, preventing continuous or arbitrary excitation.
   - **Example**: In cardiac tissue, a heartbeat is triggered only if the electrical stimulus surpasses a critical threshold.

4. **Refractory Period**:
   - **Definition**: A period following excitation during which the medium temporarily becomes less excitable or non-excitable, preventing immediate re-excitation.
   - **Example**: After a neuron fires an action potential, it enters a refractory period during which it cannot fire another action potential.

### Relating Excitatory Media to Dissipative Systems

Excitatory media and dissipative systems are interconnected concepts often found in the study of complex systems. Both describe systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium that exhibit dynamic behaviors and pattern formation through energy dissipation and local interactions. Here's how these two concepts relate to each other:

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Energy Dissipation**:
   - **Dissipative Systems**: These systems maintain order and structure by dissipating energy into their environment, often leading to complex behaviors and self-organization.
   - **Excitatory Media**: In excitatory media, local excitations propagate and dissipate energy, contributing to wave propagation and pattern formation.
   - **Example**: In a chemical reaction-diffusion system, the reaction provides the energy, and the diffusion process dissipates it.

2. **Non-equilibrium Conditions**:
   - **Dissipative Systems**: Operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, requiring a constant flow of energy to sustain their structure and dynamics.
   - **Excitatory Media**: Similarly, excitatory media require external energy input to sustain wave propagation and excitation patterns.
   - **Example**: Cardiac tissue, where the heart continuously receives energy to maintain rhythmic contractions through electrical excitation waves.

3. **Pattern Formation**:
   - **Dissipative Systems**: Self-organize into spatial or temporal patterns due to the interplay of energy input and dissipation.
   - **Excitatory Media**: Exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns, such as waves or spirals, resulting from the propagation of excitation.
   - **Example**: The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction forms spiral waves due to chemical excitations spreading through the medium.

#### Mathematical Formalism

Both excitatory media and dissipative systems can be described using similar mathematical frameworks, particularly reaction-diffusion equations.

1. **Reaction-Diffusion Equations**:
   - **General Form**:
     $$
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D_u \nabla^2 u + f(u,v)
     $$
     $$
     \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = D_v \nabla^2 v + g(u,v)
     $$
     where \(u\) and \(v\) are state variables, \(D_u\) and \(D_v\) are diffusion coefficients, and \(f\) and \(g\) describe reaction kinetics.
   - **Example in Excitatory Media**: The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a simplified version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model for nerve membrane activity, describing how an excitatory signal propagates through a medium.
   - **Example in Dissipative Systems**: The same reaction-diffusion equations can describe pattern formation in chemical systems, such as Turing patterns in morphogenesis.

2. **[[Entropy Production]] and Stability**:
   - **[[Dissipative Systems]]**: Stability and pattern formation are governed by the balance of energy input and entropy production.
     $$
     \sigma = \int_V \frac{\dot{S}}{T} dV
     $$
     where \(\sigma\) is the entropy production rate, \(\dot{S}\) is the local entropy production, and \(T\) is the temperature.
   - **Excitatory Media**: The propagation and maintenance of excitation waves are similarly influenced by the balance of energy dissipation and local interactions.
     - **Example**: The generation of action potentials in neurons requires a delicate balance of ionic flows, which dissipate energy.

### Examples in Nature and Technology

1. **Biological Systems**:
   - **Neurons and Brain Activity**: The brain functions as an excitatory medium with neurons propagating electrical signals. This process is also dissipative, as it requires constant energy input (ATP) and results in heat production.
   - **Cardiac Tissue**: The heart's rhythmic contractions are driven by electrical excitation waves, a prime example of an excitatory medium. The heart operates as a dissipative system, constantly using chemical energy to sustain electrical activity.
   - **Example**: The synchronization of neuron firing patterns can be seen as both a dissipative process (due to energy consumption and heat production) and a characteristic of an excitatory medium.

2. **Chemical Systems**:
   - **Belousov-Zhabotinsky Reaction**: This chemical oscillator demonstrates how local excitations (chemical reactions) propagate and dissipate energy, forming complex patterns. It serves as a model system for studying both excitatory media and dissipative structures.
   - **Example**: The reaction-diffusion model describing this reaction shows how excitation waves (excitatory media) lead to self-organized patterns (dissipative structures).

3. **Technological Applications**:
   - **Artificial Neural Networks**: These networks are designed to mimic the excitatory properties of biological neurons. They require energy to operate and process information, thus acting as dissipative systems.
   - **Excitable Media in Computing**: Research into unconventional computing using reaction-diffusion systems leverages the principles of excitatory media and dissipative structures to perform computations.
   - **Example**: Using chemical reactions to solve computational problems by encoding information in wave patterns.

   - **Reductionism vs. Holism**: These systems challenge reductionist approaches, emphasizing the need to understand the whole system and its interactions.
   - **Example**: Understanding cardiac arrhythmias requires studying the heart as a whole rather than just its individual cells.

### Conclusion
