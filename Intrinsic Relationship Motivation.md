### Intrinsic Relationship Motivation

**Intrinsic Relationship Motivation** refers to engaging in relationships for the inherent satisfaction, joy, and fulfillment they provide. This motivation is driven by internal rewards, such as love, companionship, emotional support, and the pleasure of sharing life experiences with others. Intrinsic relationship motivation is a key concept within [[Relationships Motivation Theory]] (RMT) and [[Self-Determination Theory]] (SDT).
