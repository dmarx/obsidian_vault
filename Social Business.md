**Social Business**

Social business refers to a business model designed to address social issues in a financially sustainable way. Unlike traditional businesses, which prioritize profit maximization, social businesses focus on creating social value and improving societal well-being. Profits generated by social businesses are reinvested into the enterprise to further its social objectives rather than being distributed to shareholders.

### Key Characteristics of Social Business

1. **Primary Social Objective**:
   - The main goal is to solve social, environmental, or economic problems, such as poverty, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability.

2. **Financial Sustainability**:
   - Social businesses operate on a financially sustainable model, generating revenue to cover operational costs and reinvest in the business to achieve its social mission.

3. **No Profit Distribution**:
   - Profits are reinvested into the business to expand its social impact rather than being distributed to shareholders or owners.

4. **Accountability and Transparency**:
   - Social businesses prioritize accountability and transparency, ensuring that their operations align with their social missions and stakeholders' expectations.

5. **Innovation and Entrepreneurship**:
   - Social businesses often employ innovative solutions and entrepreneurial approaches to address complex social issues effectively.

### Types of Social Business

1. **Type I: Non-Dividend Company**:
   - Focuses on addressing a specific social problem while being financially sustainable. Profits are reinvested into the business to expand its social impact.
   - Example: Grameen Danone Foods, which provides affordable nutrition to low-income communities in Bangladesh.

2. **Type II: Profit-Oriented Social Business**:
   - Owned by the poor or marginalized communities, who receive dividends from the business. The primary aim is still social impact, but it allows for profit distribution to improve the owners' economic conditions.
   - Example: A cooperative owned by low-income farmers that sells their produce and shares profits among the members.
