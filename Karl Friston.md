Karl Friston is a neuroscientist known for his work in brain imaging and the development of the [[Free Energy Principle]], a theory that aims to explain how biological systems maintain their order and adapt to their environment. According to Friston, living systems resist [[Entropy]] and maintain their structure by minimizing the free energy of their internal states, which is equivalent to maximizing the evidence for their model of the world. This principle can be seen as a form of [[Self-Organization|self-organization]], where systems adaptively change to [[minimize surprise]] and uncertainty. Fristonâ€™s work is highly relevant to understanding how complex adaptive systems, including biological organisms and potentially artificial intelligence, manage to sustain themselves and learn from their environment through predictive coding and minimizing free energy.
