Karl Friston is a neuroscientist known for his work in brain imaging and the development of the [[Free Energy Principle]], a theory that aims to explain how biological systems maintain their order and adapt to their environment. According to Friston, living systems resist [[Entropy]] and maintain their structure by minimizing the free energy of their internal states, which is equivalent to maximizing the evidence for their model of the world. This principle can be seen as a form of [[Self-Organization|self-organization]], where systems adaptively change to [[minimize surprise]] and uncertainty. Friston’s work is highly relevant to understanding how complex adaptive systems, including biological organisms and potentially artificial intelligence, manage to sustain themselves and learn from their environment through predictive coding and minimizing free energy.

Karl Friston's work, particularly his development of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), offers profound insights into understanding the brain, cognition, and the self from a unifying theoretical framework. Friston, a neuroscientist, has significantly influenced cognitive science, theoretical neuroscience, and related fields with his contributions. While not directly addressing the [[Multiplicitous Self|multiplicity of self]] in the same manner as some of the previously mentioned researchers and philosophers, Friston's ideas are highly relevant for integrating and extending discussions about the nature of the self, decision-making, and personal identity.

### Free Energy Principle and the Self

The Free Energy Principle posits that all living systems, including humans, act to minimize the difference between their expected internal model of the world and the actual sensory input they receive, a concept known as "free energy." This principle is used to explain a wide range of brain functions and behaviors, suggesting that organisms are essentially prediction machines that constantly update their internal models to better navigate and survive in their environment.

### Implications for Understanding the Self

- **Predictive Processing and the Self**: Friston's work on predictive processing, a core aspect of FEP, suggests that the brain's primary function is to predict sensory inputs based on internal models. This has significant implications for understanding consciousness and the self, as it posits that our perceptions, beliefs, and experiences are fundamentally shaped by these internal predictive models. It suggests that the self could be understood as an emergent property of the brain's attempt to minimize free energy, continuously shaped and reshaped by its interactions with the environment.

- **Agency and Decision-Making**: FEP and predictive processing offer a novel perspective on agency and decision-making. According to this view, decision-making is the process of selecting actions that minimize predicted error between expected and actual outcomes. This aligns with the idea of a multiplicitous self by suggesting that what we experience as decision-making and agency are outcomes of underlying neural processes striving for coherence and predictability in a complex, uncertain world.

- **[[Embodied Cognition]]**: Friston's theories also intersect with ideas of embodied cognition by emphasizing the role of the body and the environment in shaping cognitive processes. The brain's predictions are not made in a vacuum but are deeply influenced by bodily states and the external world, further supporting the concept of a self that is not strictly brain-bound but extended and embedded within its environment.

- **Interdisciplinary Impact**: Friston's ideas resonate across disciplines, contributing to ongoing discussions in philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and psychology about the nature of the self, consciousness, and how we construct our understanding of the world. His theoretical framework provides a potentially unifying approach to exploring the complexity of the self and cognition.

In summary, Karl Friston's work, particularly the Free Energy Principle, provides a powerful theoretical foundation that complements and enriches discussions on the multiplicity of the self. By framing cognition and behavior in terms of predictive processing and free energy minimization, Friston's ideas contribute to a deeper understanding of how the self is constituted and how it navigates the world.

> how do karl friston's ideas relate to panpsychism?

Karl Friston's ideas, particularly those surrounding the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and predictive processing, offer a unique lens through which to view consciousness and its place in the natural world. While Friston's work does not directly engage with panpsychism—the philosophical view that consciousness or mind-like qualities are fundamental and ubiquitous aspects of reality—it does provide a framework that could intersect with some versions of panpsychist thought, especially regarding the nature of consciousness and the organization of living systems.

### Bridging Concepts

1. **Universal Principles of Organization**: Friston's Free Energy Principle posits that living systems act to minimize free energy, or prediction error, as a universal principle of their organization. This principle, which is applied to explain how brains model their environment and guide behavior, could be seen as a universal organizing principle that might extend to all matter in some form, given a sufficiently broad interpretation. In this light, one might speculate about a panpsychist interpretation where the basic organizational principles of consciousness or mind-like qualities are present in all matter, albeit in a very rudimentary form compared to human consciousness.

2. **Predictive Processing and Consciousness**: The predictive processing model suggests that the brain constructs its perception of the world through predictive models, continuously updated by sensory input. This model-centric view of cognition could be extrapolated in a panpsychist framework to suggest that all matter engages in basic forms of information processing and prediction, akin to very basic forms of consciousness or experience.

### Philosophical Implications

- **Continuity Between Life and Non-Life**: One of the appeals of panpsychism is its potential to smooth over the apparent ontological gap between conscious, living beings and the non-conscious, inanimate matter of the universe. Friston's principles, by outlining a fundamental organizational principle that could be applicable to all systems (not just biological ones), may offer a bridge for more nuanced panpsychist theories that seek to explain how consciousness might emerge from or be related to fundamental physical processes.

- **Hierarchical and Nested Models**: Friston’s work also discusses hierarchical models in the brain, where higher levels predict lower levels in a nested fashion. This concept could be intriguingly paralleled in a panpsychist perspective by considering the universe as comprising nested levels of organization, each with its form of "predictive processing," potentially leading up to consciousness as it is observed in higher organisms.

### Divergences

It's important to note, however, that Friston's theories are grounded in empirical neuroscience and are not designed as contributions to metaphysical debates about the fundamental nature of consciousness or its distribution in the universe. Panpsychism, on the other hand, is a philosophical position with implications that extend beyond current scientific observation. While Friston's work provides a robust framework for understanding the organization of living systems and the nature of human consciousness, linking it directly to panpsychism would require a speculative leap, intertwining empirical theories with metaphysical propositions.

In conclusion, while Karl Friston's work on the Free Energy Principle and predictive processing does not directly address panpsychism, the concepts and models he develops offer intriguing points of contact with the philosophical questions surrounding consciousness. These intersections might inspire fruitful dialogue between empirical neuroscience and philosophical inquiry into the nature and ubiquity of consciousness across the universe.


> maybe panpsychism isn't the right word. i'm less concerned with things like qualia and subjective experience than with whether or not we should consider organizations and collectives as subject to similar processes as those which underlie whatever our personal agency might be, and hence relating the free energy principle and preservation of self-organizing systems that can adopt a sense of "bodily integrity" and "continuity of self", and therefore having consequences for what we should consider "conscious entities" capable of agency and culpability

Reframing the question around the Free Energy Principle (FEP), organizations, and collectives brings us into a fascinating intersection of cognitive science, systems theory, and philosophy of mind. Friston's work, particularly the Free Energy Principle, suggests a universal principle for understanding how living systems maintain their structure and function in the face of a constantly changing environment. This principle hinges on minimizing free energy or prediction error, essentially how a system's model of the world is continuously updated to reduce discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory inputs.

### Application to Organizations and Collectives

When we extend the idea of minimizing free energy to organizations and collectives, we venture into viewing these entities as self-organizing systems that strive to maintain coherence and identity over time. This perspective suggests several parallels with the notions of "bodily integrity" and "continuity of self" that are typically applied to individual organisms:

1. **[[Self-Organization]]**: Just as individual organisms self-organize by regulating their internal states in response to external conditions, organizations and collectives self-organize through structures, roles, and norms that adapt to their environments. The coherence of these entities relies on their capacity to minimize internal discrepancies and respond adaptively to external challenges.

2. **Bodily Integrity and [[Continuity of Self]]**: In the context of organizations and collectives, "bodily integrity" can be metaphorically understood as the integrity of the system's structure and processes that allow it to function and pursue its goals. "Continuity of self" translates to the persistence of an organization's identity and purpose over time, despite changes in membership, leadership, or external conditions. Both concepts imply a form of homeostasis that these entities maintain to persist as coherent units.

3. **[[Agency]] and Culpability**: Viewing organizations and collectives through the lens of the Free Energy Principle raises intriguing questions about agency and culpability. If these entities exhibit behaviors aimed at minimizing free energy, one might argue that they possess a form of agency—a capacity to act in the world to preserve their integrity and achieve their goals. This, in turn, suggests that organizations and collectives could bear responsibility for their actions, much as individuals do, especially when those actions are understood as efforts to maintain their coherence and identity.

### Philosophical and Ethical Implications

This framework prompts a reevaluation of how we attribute agency and moral responsibility. Traditionally confined to individuals, the concepts of agency and culpability might need expansion to account for the collective actions of organizations and systems that operate under principles similar to those guiding individual behavior:

- **Moral Responsibility of Collectives**: Can and should organizations be held morally responsible for their actions? If an organization's directives and structures are designed to minimize free energy (maintain coherence and pursue goals), then its actions are not merely the sum of individual members' actions but reflect a collective intentionality.

- **Ethics of Systemic Actions**: This perspective necessitates an ethical framework that considers the actions of collectives and their impacts on individuals and other systems. It challenges us to consider how systems can be designed and governed to ensure ethical behavior at the collective level.

- **Agency Beyond Biology**: Extending the concept of agency to non-biological entities like organizations invites deeper questions about what constitutes agency and consciousness. It suggests a broader, more inclusive understanding of how systems interact with their environments and make decisions, which may not be limited to the domain of conscious awareness as traditionally understood.

In summary, applying Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle to organizations and collectives not only broadens our understanding of agency and identity but also challenges us to rethink ethical responsibility in a world where human and non-human systems are increasingly intertwined. It opens a dialog between cognitive science, philosophy, and ethics about the nature of agency, the boundaries of self-organizing systems, and the responsibilities they bear in the larger ecological and social fabric.
