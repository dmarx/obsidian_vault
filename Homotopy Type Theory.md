[[Homotopy Type Theory]] (HoTT) is a modern branch of mathematics that combines concepts from [[type theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[higher category theory]] to create a new foundation for mathematics and computer science. It is an extension of the propositions-as-types correspondence (also known as the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]]), which equates types with propositions and terms with proofs. HoTT introduces the idea that types can be regarded as spaces, terms as points in these spaces, and equalities as paths between points. This perspective allows for a rich interplay between algebraic and geometric reasoning, providing new insights into the structure of proofs and the nature of mathematical objects.

### Key Concepts

- **Types as Spaces**: In HoTT, a type is viewed as a [[topological space]] rather than a simple collection of elements. This analogy allows for the use of geometric and topological intuitions when reasoning about types.

- **Equality as Paths**: Equality between two terms in HoTT is represented by a path in the space associated with their type. This means that proving two terms are equal is equivalent to constructing a path between them in their space.

- **[[Homotopy]] and [[Higher Inductive Types]]**: Homotopy is a concept from topology that considers two paths equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other. HoTT generalizes this idea to types, leading to the concept of higher inductive types (HITs), which allow for the construction of complex spaces and the encoding of mathematical structures like the circle, sphere, and more.

- **[[Univalence Axiom]]**: Proposed by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], the Univalence Axiom is a central principle in HoTT that equates the equivalence of types with equality between types. This axiom has profound implications for the philosophy of mathematics, suggesting that mathematical objects are determined by their structural properties rather than their set-theoretic underpinnings.

### Mathematical Formalism

A core aspect of HoTT is its use of $\Pi$-types and $\Sigma$-types, which generalize the notions of [[function types]] and [[product types]], respectively, to account for dependent types. For example, a $\Pi$-type can represent the type of functions from any type $A$ to a [[family of types]] $B(a)$ indexed by $A$, symbolically written as $\Pi_{a:A} B(a)$. This represents the space of all functions that, for each element $a$ of type $A$, select an element of the type $B(a)$.

### Applications and Implications

- **Foundations of Mathematics**: HoTT offers a new foundation for mathematics that is constructive and computationally interpretable, providing an alternative to traditional set theory.

- **Proof Assistants**: HoTT has significantly impacted the development of proof assistants, such as Agda and Lean, enabling more intuitive and geometric reasoning about types and proofs.

- **[[Philosophy of Mathematics]]**: The Univalence Axiom and the interpretation of types as spaces offer new perspectives on the nature of mathematical objects and equivalence, challenging conventional views on identity and classification in mathematics.

### Conclusion

Homotopy Type Theory represents a significant evolution in our understanding of types, propositions, and mathematical objects. By integrating geometric intuition with logical and computational frameworks, HoTT opens up new avenues for research in mathematics, computer science, and the philosophy of mathematics. Its development is still ongoing, with researchers exploring its implications, extending its foundations, and applying its principles to solve complex problems in both theory and practice.
