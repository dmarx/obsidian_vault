In mathematics, a [[Manifolds]] is a [[Topological Space|space]] that might be complex globally but resembles simpler [[Euclidean Space]] locally. For instance, the surface of a sphere is a 2-dimensional manifold: although it's curved and exists in 3-dimensional space, any small enough area of the sphere looks flat, much like a piece of paper (which is a 2-dimensional space).
