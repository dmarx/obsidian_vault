**Amari's Alpha-Geometry**

- **Expanding the Geometry of Information**
  - From Fisher Information to [[Information Geometry]]: Outline how [[Fisher Information]] metric contributes to the foundation of information geometry, which studies the [[Differential Geometry|differential geometric]] structure of statistical manifolds.
  - Alpha-Geometry: Introduction to [[Shun-ichi Amari]]'s concept of Alpha-Geometry, which generalizes information geometry by introducing a family of dual connections on statistical [[Manifolds]], parameterized by α.

- **Dualistic Structure and Alpha-Families**
  - Dual Connections and [[Divergence]]: Explain the concept of dual affine connections in the context of Alpha-Geometry and how they lead to a dualistic structure on statistical manifolds, characterizing divergence functions.
  - Alpha-Families of Distributions: Discuss how different values of α result in different geometrical structures (e.g., the Fisher metric at α=0, and [[Dual Geometries]] at α=±1), and their implications for understanding the geometry of statistical models.
