- [[Fractal Structures]]

Fractal geometry is a branch of mathematics that extends the concept of dimensionality beyond integers, exploring shapes and patterns that exhibit complexity at every scale. It diverges from traditional Euclidean geometry by focusing on irregular and fragmented shapes that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-scale copy of the whole, a property known as [[self-similarity]]. Fractal geometry provides a mathematical framework for understanding the intricacies of natural phenomena and structures that do not conform to the simple shapes described by classical geometry.

### Key Concepts in Fractal Geometry

- **Self-Similarity**: This is the defining characteristic of fractals. A self-similar object looks roughly the same at any scale. This property can be exact, as in mathematical fractals like the [[Sierpinski Triangle]] or the [[Mandelbrot Set]], or statistical, as in natural fractals like coastlines or mountain ranges.
- **[[Fractal Dimension]]**: Unlike traditional geometric figures, which have integer dimensions (1D for a line, 2D for a square, etc.), fractals are characterized by non-integer (fractional) dimensions. The fractal dimension quantifies the complexity of the fractal, reflecting how its detail changes with scale. The [[Hausdorff dimension]], a specific type of fractal dimension, is often used to describe the dimensionality of fractals mathematically.
  
  The fractal dimension $D$ can be related to the scaling rule where a fractal pattern scales down by a factor of $r$ and this scaling results in $N$ self-similar pieces. The relation is given by:
  $$D = \frac{\log N}{\log (1/r)}$$

- **Iteration and Recursive Processes**: Many fractals are constructed through [[iterated function systems|iterative processes]] or recursive algorithms. Starting from a simple initial shape, the process applies a set of rules repeatedly to transform the shape into a more complex pattern. This iterative process can theoretically continue indefinitely, producing finer and more intricate details.

### Mathematical and Natural Fractals

Fractal geometry is not only a mathematical curiosity but also a practical tool for modeling and understanding the complexity found in nature and various scientific fields. 

**Mathematical Fractals**: These are idealized constructs defined by precise mathematical formulas and rules. Examples include:
- The [[Mandelbrot Set]], a set of complex numbers for which the function $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ does not diverge when iterated from $z=0$.
- The [[Koch Snowflake]], which begins as an equilateral triangle, and each iteration adds smaller triangles to each side, leading to an infinitely long perimeter.

**[[Natural Fractals]]**: These are structures in nature that exhibit fractal-like properties, although they may not be perfect fractals throughout all scales. Examples include:
- Coastlines, which exhibit similar levels of detail and complexity whether viewed from far away or up close.
- Vegetation patterns, where the branching structure of trees and plants shows self-similar patterns.
- Mountain landscapes, where the roughness and fragmentation of terrain show fractal properties over a range of scales.

### Applications of Fractal Geometry

Fractal geometry has found applications across a wide range of fields:
- **Physics**: In the study of chaos, turbulence, and the structure of the universe.
- **Biology**: To describe the growth patterns of organisms and the structure of biological systems.
- **Computer Graphics**: For generating realistic natural landscapes, clouds, and textures in film and video games.
- **Medicine**: Analyzing the patterns of diseases, such as the fractal nature of tumor growth.
- **Finance**: Modeling price movements in markets, which often exhibit fractal patterns.

Fractal geometry challenges and expands our understanding of dimensionality, patterns, and complexity, offering a unique perspective on both the natural world and abstract mathematical concepts. Its ability to describe real-world phenomena with mathematical precision underscores the intrinsic connection between mathematics and the structure of the universe.
