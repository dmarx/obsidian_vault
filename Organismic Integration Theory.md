### Organismic Integration Theory

**Organismic Integration Theory (OIT)** is a sub-theory within the broader framework of [[Self-Determination Theory]] (SDT) developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. OIT explains the different forms of extrinsic motivation and how these forms vary in terms of the degree of autonomy and self-determination involved. It details the process by which external regulations are internalized and integrated into one’s [[Self-Concept]].

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Organismic Integration Theory addresses how individuals internalize external motivations and the varying degrees of self-determination associated with different types of extrinsic motivation.

2. **Types of Motivation**:
   OIT identifies a continuum of motivational states ranging from amotivation to intrinsic motivation, with several forms of extrinsic motivation in between. These forms differ based on how autonomously regulated they are:

   - **Amotivation**: Lack of motivation or intention to act.
   - **Extrinsic Motivation**:
     - **External Regulation**: Behavior driven by external rewards or punishments.
     - **Introjected Regulation**: Behavior driven by internal pressures, such as guilt or obligation.
     - **Identified Regulation**: Behavior aligned with personal goals and values but not inherently enjoyable.
     - **Integrated Regulation**: Behavior fully assimilated with the self, reflecting personal values and needs.
   - **Intrinsic Motivation**: Engaging in an activity for its inherent satisfaction and enjoyment.

3. **Internalization and Integration**:
   The process of moving from externally regulated behavior to integrated regulation involves internalization, where external regulations are progressively transformed into self-regulation.

   - **Internalization**: The process by which individuals take in values, attitudes, or regulations from external sources.
   - **Integration**: The process by which internalized values and regulations are fully assimilated into the self, becoming part of one’s self-concept.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Autonomy Support**:
   - **Autonomy-Supportive Environments**: Contexts that provide choice, encourage self-initiation, and acknowledge individuals' perspectives facilitate internalization and integration of extrinsic motivations.

2. **Competence and Relatedness**:
   - **Competence**: Positive feedback and opportunities to develop mastery support the internalization process by enhancing feelings of competence.
   - **Relatedness**: A sense of belonging and connection with others supports internalization by making external values more meaningful and relevant.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Ryan and Connell (1989)**:
   - **Study**: Examined children’s reasons for engaging in school activities, categorizing their motivations along the OIT continuum.
   - **Results**: Found that more self-determined forms of regulation (identified and integrated) were associated with greater persistence, performance, and well-being.

2. **Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, and Leone (1994)**:
   - **Experiment**: Tested the effects of autonomy support on the internalization of extrinsic motivation.
   - **Results**: Participants who received autonomy support showed greater internalization and integration of the activity compared to those in controlling conditions.

3. **Williams, Grow, Freedman, Ryan, and Deci (1996)**:
   - **Study**: Investigated the role of autonomous motivation in health behaviors.
   - **Results**: Found that patients with more self-determined motivation for health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation) were more likely to maintain these behaviors over time.

#### Mathematical Formalization

To formalize OIT, consider a model that captures the continuum of motivational states and the process of internalization:

1. **[[Motivational Continuum]]**:
   - Let $M$ represent the level of motivation, ranging from $M_{am}$ (amotivation) to $M_{in}$ (intrinsic motivation), with intermediate levels representing various forms of extrinsic motivation ($M_{ex}$).

2. **Internalization Process**:
   - The probability of internalizing an external regulation $E$ into a more autonomous form $I$ can be modeled as:
   $$
   P(I \mid E) = f(A, C, R)
   $$
   where $A$, $C$, and $R$ represent the satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, respectively, and $f$ is a function reflecting the internalization process.

3. **Degree of Self-Determination**:
   - The degree of self-determination $D$ associated with a behavior can be expressed as a weighted sum of its regulatory components:
   $$
   D = w_{ex}M_{ex} + w_{in}M_{in}
   $$
   where $w_{ex}$ and $w_{in}$ are weights representing the extent to which behavior is extrinsically or intrinsically motivated.

#### Implications

1. **Education**:
   - **Teaching Practices**: Educators should create autonomy-supportive environments to facilitate the internalization of educational goals, leading to more self-determined motivation and better learning outcomes.

2. **Workplace**:
   - **Management Practices**: Employers should foster environments that support autonomy, competence, and relatedness to enhance the internalization of organizational values and goals, leading to greater employee engagement and performance.

3. **Healthcare**:
   - **Patient Motivation**: Healthcare providers should support patients’ autonomy and provide competence-enhancing feedback to promote the internalization of health-related behaviors, leading to better adherence and outcomes.
