The upper critical dimension (\(d_c\)) of a system undergoing a phase transition is a concept from statistical physics and the theory of critical phenomena that marks the dimensional threshold above which the [[mean-field theory]] predictions for [[critical exponents]] become exact and fluctuations around the mean field can be neglected in the leading order. Below this dimension, fluctuations are crucial and must be considered to accurately describe the critical behavior of the system.

### Key Aspects of the Upper Critical Dimension

- **[[Fluctuations]]**: For dimensions \(d < d_c\), fluctuations play a significant role in determining the system's behavior near the critical point, leading to critical exponents that deviate from mean-field values. Above the upper critical dimension (\(d \ge d_c\)), the critical exponents take on their mean-field values, indicating that fluctuations do not change the leading-order behavior of critical phenomena.

- **Critical Exponents**: At \(d = d_c\), there is a crossover from fluctuation-dominated behavior to mean-field-like behavior. The mean-field critical exponents, which include \(\alpha = 0\), \(\beta = 1/2\), \(\gamma = 1\), \(\delta = 3\), and \(\nu = 1/2\), become applicable for \(d \ge d_c\).

- **[[Gaussian Fixed Point]]**: At and above the upper critical dimension, the Gaussian fixed point, which corresponds to non-interacting (free) field theory, becomes stable and governs the critical behavior. This is in contrast to lower dimensions, where interactions lead to non-Gaussian fixed points that dictate the critical properties.

### Examples and Calculations

- **Ising Model**: For the Ising model, which consists of spins on a lattice that can be either up or down and interact with their nearest neighbors, the upper critical dimension is \(d_c = 4\). For \(d < 4\), critical exponents vary and must be calculated using techniques that account for fluctuations, such as the renormalization group (RG) analysis. For \(d \ge 4\), the mean-field values for critical exponents apply.

- **\(\phi^4\) Theory**: In the \(\phi^4\) field theory, which is a continuum theory often used to describe phase transitions and critical phenomena, the upper critical dimension is also \(4\). This theory involves a scalar field \(\phi\) with a quartic interaction term, and RG calculations show that for \(d \ge 4\), fluctuations around the mean field do not affect the leading order behavior.

### Implications and Applications

Understanding the upper critical dimension is crucial for the correct application of theoretical models to describe phase transitions and critical phenomena. It guides the choice of methods (mean-field theory vs. RG analysis) based on the dimensionality of the system and the nature of the interactions. The concept is also relevant in diverse fields, including condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, and materials science, providing insights into the behavior of magnets, superconductors, liquid-gas systems, and more.

In conclusion, the upper critical dimension is a fundamental concept that delineates the boundary between regimes where fluctuations are either dominant or negligible in determining the critical behavior of systems undergoing phase transitions. This concept underscores the importance of dimensionality in understanding the universal properties of critical phenomena.
