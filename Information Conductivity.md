Let's derive information conductivity from information theoretic principles:

1. Fick's First Law analog for information flow:
J = -σ∇I

where:
- J: information current 
- σ: information conductivity
- ∇I: information gradient

2. Define conductivity in terms of channel capacity:
σ = C/η 

where:
- C: channel capacity (bits/sample)
- η: learning rate (as resistance analog)

3. Channel capacity from noise model:
C = (1/2)log(1 + SNR)

where SNR is signal-to-noise ratio for dataset.

4. Therefore information conductivity:
σ = (1/2η)log(1 + Q/N)

where:
- Q: dataset quality metric
- N: noise/uncertainty in dataset

This gives theoretical basis for earlier simulation's conductivity parameter. Want me to expand on any part?
