**Fundamental Rights**

Fundamental rights are the basic and inalienable rights that are considered essential for the dignity, freedom, and well-being of individuals. These rights are often enshrined in constitutions, international human rights treaties, and national laws, serving as a safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by the state.

### Key Characteristics of Fundamental Rights

1. **Inalienability**:
   - Fundamental rights are inherent to every individual by virtue of being human and cannot be surrendered or transferred.

2. **Universality**:
   - These rights apply to all individuals regardless of nationality, race, gender, religion, or any other status.

3. **Indivisibility**:
   - Fundamental rights are interdependent and indivisible, meaning that the protection of one right often depends on the protection of others.

4. **Enforceability**:
   - Fundamental rights are typically enforceable through judicial systems, allowing individuals to seek redress when their rights are violated.

### Legal Frameworks Protecting Fundamental Rights

     - **Indian Constitution**: [[Fundamental Rights in the Constitution of India|Part III of the Constitution of India lists fundamental rights]], including the right to equality, freedom, and constitutional remedies.

2. **International Human Rights Instruments**:
   - Various international treaties and declarations set out fundamental rights and obligations for states:
     - **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)**: Adopted by the United Nations in 1948, it sets out fundamental human rights to be universally protected.
     - **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**: A multilateral treaty that commits its parties to respect civil and political rights.

3. **Human Rights Commissions and Ombudspersons**:
   - National and international human rights commissions and ombudspersons investigate and address complaints of rights violations, often providing non-judicial remedies.
