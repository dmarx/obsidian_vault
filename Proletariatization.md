"Proletariatization" refers to the socio-economic process by which individuals or groups are integrated into the working class, particularly in contexts where they might previously have been self-employed or engaged in independent economic activities. This term is closely associated with Marxist theory, where it describes the transformation of small-scale producers, artisans, and peasants into wage laborers as part of the broader dynamics of capitalist development.

### Key Aspects of Proletariatization:

1. **Economic Shift**: This process involves a shift from self-employment or subsistence farming to wage labor, typically due to economic pressures, technological advancements, or market changes that undermine traditional forms of livelihood.

2. **[[Loss of Autonomy]]**: Individuals undergoing proletariatization often experience a loss of control over the means of production and their work conditions. Instead of owning their tools and dictating their work schedules, they are employed by others and must adhere to the labor demands and schedules set by their employers.

3. **Integration into Capitalist Economy**: Proletariatization is a critical component in the development of a capitalist economy. It increases the labor force necessary for industrial growth and urbanization, aligning more people with the economic model of production and consumption driven by wage earning.

4. **Social Transformation**: The process also has profound social implications, as it affects class structures, family dynamics, and community relationships. Traditional roles and social relations may be disrupted as individuals and communities adapt to new economic realities.

5. **Historical and Global Context**: Historically, this process was integral to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and America, where large populations moved from rural areas to cities for factory jobs. In contemporary times, similar processes can be observed globally, especially in developing countries where industrialization and urbanization are ongoing.

In Marxist discourse, proletariatization is often discussed in relation to capitalist exploitation and alienation, where the worker is alienated from the product of their labor, the act of production, and their fellow workers, leading to a dehumanized existence within the capitalist system. This concept is crucial for understanding the dynamics of class struggle and the potential for revolutionary change as envisioned in Marxist philosophy.
