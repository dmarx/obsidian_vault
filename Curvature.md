In geometry, curvature is a measure of how much a curve deviates from being a straight line, or a surface deviates from being a plane. For surfaces, the concept of curvature is more nuanced and includes both [[Gaussian Curvature]], which is intrinsic to the surface and independent of its embedding in space, and [[Extrinsic Curvature]], which depends on how the surface is embedded in the surrounding space. Gaussian curvature at a point on a surface intuitively measures the product of the maximum and minimum bending of the surface at that point.
