The Schr√∂dinger equation is fundamental to quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It is a first-order PDE in time, but involves second-order spatial derivatives:

$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi $$

where $\psi$ is the wave function of the system, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $m$ is the mass, and $V$ represents the potential energy.
