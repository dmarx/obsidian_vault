>hawkes processes and networks science

Hawkes processes are a class of mathematical models used to describe the behavior of systems where events occur in clusters and the occurrence of one event increases the probability of future events happening in a short period after the initial event. This self-exciting property makes Hawkes processes particularly suitable for modeling phenomena where past events influence the likelihood of future events, a characteristic common in many real-world systems, including financial markets, seismology, and social networks. Integrating Hawkes processes with network science offers powerful tools for understanding and predicting dynamics on networks, especially in contexts where interactions between nodes (individuals, entities, etc.) lead to cascading or clustering of activities.

### Hawkes Processes in Network Science

In the context of network science, Hawkes processes can be used to model and analyze temporal dynamics on networks, such as the spread of information, behaviors, or even diseases, where the occurrence of an event at one node increases the likelihood of subsequent events at neighboring nodes. This approach is particularly useful for studying:

- **Information Diffusion:** Modeling how information, rumors, or innovations spread across social networks, with each share or retweet increasing the likelihood of further shares in the network's vicinity.
  
- **Behavioral Contagion:** Understanding how behaviors, practices, or decisions spread through a population, where the adoption by one individual increases the chances of adoption by their friends or contacts.
  
- **Financial Transactions:** Analyzing patterns in trading activity, where trades or price movements in one part of the market influence future trades in related securities or markets.

### Mathematical Formulation

A basic Hawkes process can be mathematically described by its [[intensity function]], \(\lambda(t)\), which represents the expected rate of events at time \(t\), given all previous events:

$$ \lambda(t) = \mu + \sum_{t_i < t} \phi(t - t_i) $$

Here, \(\mu\) is the baseline rate of events, and \(\phi(t - t_i)\) is a memory kernel that describes how past events \(t_i\) influence the current rate of events. The function \(\phi\) typically takes a form that decreases with time since the past event, indicating that the influence of past events wanes over time.

When applying Hawkes processes to networks, this formulation can be extended to account for the network structure, where the intensity function for an event occurring at node \(j\) at time \(t\), given previous events, can include terms that account for the influence of events at neighboring nodes.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Model Complexity:** Incorporating network structure into Hawkes processes increases model complexity, especially for large networks with rich temporal dynamics.

- **Parameter Estimation:** Estimating the parameters of networked Hawkes processes, including the baseline rates and the influence of past events, requires sophisticated statistical techniques and can be computationally intensive.

- **Causality vs. Correlation:** While Hawkes processes can model the clustering of events in time and across network nodes, distinguishing between causality and mere correlation in event sequences remains challenging.

### Applications and Insights

The integration of Hawkes processes with network science has facilitated new insights across various fields:

- **Epidemiology:** Modeling the spread of diseases where the infection of an individual increases the risk to those connected in a social or physical network.

- **Social Media Analysis:** Understanding viral phenomena, where the posting or sharing behavior of users influences further postings and shares within their network.

- **Seismology:** Predicting aftershock sequences where one earthquake increases the probability of subsequent earthquakes in nearby faults.

By combining the temporal dynamics modeling capabilities of Hawkes processes with the structural insights of network science, researchers and practitioners can better understand, predict, and potentially influence the spread of phenomena across networks. This interdisciplinary approach opens up new possibilities for tackling complex problems in social systems, finance, epidemiology, and beyond.
