A **Cauchy sequence** is a fundamental concept in mathematical analysis, particularly in the study of sequences in [[Metric Space|metric spaces]] and [[normed vector spaces]]. It is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses. The concept is crucial for understanding convergence in spaces that are not necessarily equipped with a standard notion of distance, like the real numbers with their usual absolute difference metric.

### Definition

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, where $X$ is a set and $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a metric (distance function) on $X$. A sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $X$ is called a **Cauchy sequence** if, for every real number $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all integers $m, n > N$, the distance between $x_m$ and $x_n$ is less than $\epsilon$:

$$
d(x_m, x_n) < \epsilon
$$

This definition means that as you pick terms later and later in the sequence, the distance between any two of those terms gets smaller and smaller, indicating that the terms of the sequence are "clustering" together.

### Properties and Significance

- **Convergence in [[Completeness|Complete Spaces]]**: A metric space $(X, d)$ is **complete** if every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges to a limit that is also in $X$. The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard metric, complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, and Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ are examples of complete spaces. In these spaces, being a Cauchy sequence is equivalent to being convergent.

- **Non-Completeness**: In metric spaces that are not complete, there exist Cauchy sequences that do not converge within the space. The process of **completion** of a space involves adding "missing" limit points to make every Cauchy sequence converge within the space, thus creating a complete space.

- **Generalization to Normed Spaces**: In normed vector spaces $(V, \|\cdot\|)$, the notion of a Cauchy sequence is defined similarly, using the norm to define the distance: a sequence $\{v_n\}$ in $V$ is Cauchy if, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N$ such that $\|v_m - v_n\| < \epsilon$ for all $m, n > N$. This generalization is crucial in functional analysis and the study of [[Banach Space|Banach spaces]] and [[Hilbert Space|Hilbert spaces]].

### Applications

- **Analysis**: Cauchy sequences are instrumental in defining and understanding convergence, especially in the development of the real numbers through Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.

- **Functional Analysis**: They are key in studying the properties of function spaces, such as those of continuous functions or integrable functions, where the concept of completeness underpins much of the theory.

- **Number Theory and Beyond**: The concept of Cauchyness has implications in various fields, including number theory (e.g., $p$-adic numbers), topology, and beyond, where the idea of elements becoming arbitrarily close plays a critical role in the structure of mathematical theories.

In summary, Cauchy sequences provide a rigorous way to discuss the closeness of sequence terms in a space, offering a pathway to the formal study of convergence and the completeness of spaces in analysis.
