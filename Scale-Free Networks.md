Scale-free networks are characterized by their nodes' connectivity distribution, which follows a [[Power-Law Distributions|power law]]. In such networks, most nodes have only a few connections, while a small number of nodes (hubs) have a very high number of connections. This pattern is observed in various real-world networks, including the Internet, social networks, biological networks (like neural networks and protein interaction networks), and citation networks.

The formation and growth mechanisms of scale-free networks often involve [[Preferential Attachment]], where new nodes are more likely to connect to existing nodes that already have a high degree of connectivity. This "rich get richer" phenomenon leads to the emergence of hubs, a hallmark of scale-free networks.
