### Phase Change Learning Dynamics and "Grocking"

"Grocking" refers to a sudden leap in the learning capability of a model, where it rapidly goes from barely improving to suddenly achieving high performance. This phenomenon can be seen as a type of [[Phase Transitions|phase transition]] in [[Learning Dynamics]], akin to physical systems undergoing phase changes (e.g., from liquid to gas). The connection to [[Attractors]] and [[Singularities]] lies in the idea that the learning process may encounter [[Critical Points]] in the [[Loss Landscape|parameter]] or state space that trigger these dramatic shifts in performance. At these points, small changes can lead to the system rapidly converging to a [[Attractor Basins|new attractor]] that represents a more effective learning state.

### [[Grokking]] and Sudden Learning Breakthroughs

Grokking, where a neural network suddenly "gets" a problem after a period of seeming stagnation, might be understood through these concepts. A network at or near [[Criticality]], exploring a connected mode landscape, may suddenly find a pathway through [[Singularities|singular points]] that lead to a significantly better understanding or representation of the problem, resulting in a grokking phenomenon. This breakthrough can be seen as the network [[Phase Transitions|transitioning]] to a deeper, more effective mode of operation that was previously inaccessible or hidden in the landscape.
