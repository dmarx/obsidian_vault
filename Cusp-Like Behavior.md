The cusp-like behavior near critical points, particularly observed in the context of specific heat and other thermodynamic quantities, refers to a situation where a physical quantity does not diverge (become infinite) but instead shows a sharp, non-analytic change as the system approaches the [[critical temperature]] \(T_c\). This behavior is distinct from the divergence characterized by positive [[critical exponents]] and is often associated with a negative or zero critical exponent, such as \(\alpha\), in the case of specific heat.

### Characteristics of Cusp-like Behavior

1. **Non-Divergent but Singular**: Unlike quantities that diverge at the critical point, cusp-like behavior signifies a sharp but finite change. The specific heat, for instance, may exhibit a pronounced peak or a discontinuity in its derivative with respect to temperature, reflecting a rapid but bounded change in the system's energy storage capacity as it undergoes a [[Phase Transitions|phase transition]].

2. **[[Critical Exponents|Critical Exponent]] \(\alpha\)**: The critical exponent \(\alpha\), related to the specific heat's behavior, can be zero or negative for systems exhibiting cusp-like behavior. For \(\alpha < 0\), the [[specific heat]] does not diverge but still displays a [[Singularities|singularity]], indicative of the critical fluctuations' influence on the system. When \(\alpha = 0\), logarithmic corrections to scaling may occur, leading to a subtler form of singularity.

3. **Analytic Description**: Mathematically, cusp-like behavior can be described by expressions that capture the non-divergent but still singular response of a quantity near \(T_c\). For example, the specific heat \(C\) near \(T_c\) might behave as:
   $$ C \sim \log|T - T_c| $$
   for \(\alpha = 0\), or show a finite jump without divergence for negative \(\alpha\).

### Physical Implications and Examples

- **[[Second-Order Phase Transitions]]**: Cusp-like behavior is often associated with second-order (continuous) phase transitions, where the order parameter changes smoothly, and there are significant fluctuations near the critical point. The specific heat's cusp-like behavior reflects the changing landscape of these fluctuations.

- **Quantum Phase Transitions**: In quantum phase transitions, observed at absolute zero temperature as a function of non-thermal control parameters (e.g., magnetic field), cusp-like behavior in derivatives of the ground state energy can similarly signify the transition points.

- **[[Mean-Field Theory]]**: In the context of mean-field theory, which applies above the [[upper critical dimension]] of a system, cusp-like behavior becomes prominent. Mean-field approximations often predict a second-order phase transition with a specific heat exhibiting a discontinuity in its derivative, corresponding to \(\alpha = 0\).

- **Materials Science and Condensed Matter Physics**: Materials that exhibit phase transitions, such as ferromagnets (near the Curie temperature) or superconductors (near the critical temperature), can display cusp-like behavior in their specific heat. This feature is a crucial indicator of the transition and provides insights into the material's underlying physics.

Cusp-like behavior near critical points underscores the nuanced ways in which physical systems can respond to changes in temperature or other control parameters, revealing the complexity of [[critical phenomena]] and the diversity of behaviors exhibited by materials undergoing phase transitions. Understanding this behavior is essential for both theoretical models and practical applications, such as tuning material properties for technological uses.
