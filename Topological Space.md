A [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") is a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") endowed with a structure, called a [[Topology]], which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of [[Continuity]]. [[Euclidean Space]], and, more generally, [[Metric Space]] are examples of topological spaces, as any distance or metric defines a topology. The deformations that are considered in topology are [[Homeomorphism]] and [[Homotopy]]. A property that is invariant under such deformations is a "topological property". The following are basic examples of topological properties:
- [[Dimension]]
- [[Compactness]]
- [[Connectivity]]
