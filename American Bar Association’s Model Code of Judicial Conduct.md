**The American Bar Association’s Model Code of Judicial Conduct**

The American Bar Association’s (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Conduct is a comprehensive set of ethical guidelines designed to ensure that judges in the United States maintain the highest standards of judicial and personal conduct. The Model Code provides a framework for ethical behavior that promotes integrity, impartiality, and independence within the judiciary.

### Overview

3. **Adoption and Enforcement**:
