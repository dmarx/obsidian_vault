todo: copy over the intro from the KLMC2 superposition notebook

but yeah the cond and the negative cond are like attractive and repulsive forces

what are some of the benefits of modeling things as [[Potential Fields|potentials]]?

- [[Laplace Operator]] as a measure of local curvature
- [[Green's Functions]] as a divergence

>- **[[Harmonic Functions]]:** Functions that satisfy Laplace's equation are known as harmonic functions. They have numerous nice properties, including the mean value property, which states that the value of a harmonic function at a point is equal to the average of its values on any sphere centered at that point.

>- **[[Heat Equation]]:** The Laplace operator also appears in the heat equation, which describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time:
