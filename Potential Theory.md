Potential theory is a branch of mathematical analysis that deals with harmonic functions, the [[Laplace operator]], and related concepts of potentials. Originally developed to solve physical problems involving gravitational and electrostatic fields, potential theory has evolved to include a broad range of applications in mathematics and physics. It provides a rich framework for understanding and solving problems in which the notion of a "potential" plays a central role.

### Core Concepts

- **[[Harmonic Functions]]:** These are functions that satisfy [[Laplace's equation]], $\Delta f = 0$. Harmonic functions arise naturally in potential theory as they describe [[Potential Fields]] in free space, where there are no [[sources]] or [[sinks]]. The properties of harmonic functions, such as the [[maximum principle]] and the [[mean value property]], are foundational to potential theory.

- **The [[Laplace Operator]]:** The Laplace operator, $\Delta$, is a differential operator given by the [[divergence]] of the [[gradient]] of a function. It plays a central role in defining both harmonic functions (when $\Delta f = 0$) and more generally, potential functions, which satisfy Poisson's equation, $\Delta f = \rho$, where $\rho$ is a source density.

- **[[Green's Functions]]:** These are solutions to differential equations that are used to express the potential in terms of source distributions. Green's functions play a key role in potential theory by providing an explicit representation of potentials generated by localized sources.

- **[[Capacity]] and Equilibrium Measures:** Potential theory also studies concepts of capacity, which measures the ability of a conductor to hold [[charge]], and [[equilibrium]] measures, which distribute charge on a conductor to produce a constant potential. These notions are used to quantify and understand the behavior of potential fields.

### Applications and Significance

- **Electrostatics and Gravitation:** Potential theory was initially developed to describe the potential energy fields in electrostatics and gravitation. In these contexts, it provides a mathematical framework for calculating the forces and potential energy distributions resulting from configurations of charges or masses.

- **Fluid Dynamics:** Inviscid, irrotational fluid flows can be described by potential functions, where the fluid velocity is given by the gradient of the potential. Potential theory is used to solve various problems in fluid dynamics, such as flow around obstacles.

- **Mathematical Physics:** Beyond classical physics, potential theory finds applications in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and field theory, where potentials describe interactions and fields.

- **Complex Analysis:** In complex analysis, potential theory relates to the study of analytic functions through the Laplace equation in two dimensions. This connection provides powerful tools for solving problems in two-dimensional domains.

- **[[Probability Theory]]:** In the study of [[stochastic processes]], especially [[Brownian motion]] and [[Markov processes]], potential theory offers insights into hitting probabilities, first passage times, and the behavior of paths.

- **[[Partial Differential Equations]] (PDEs):** Potential theory provides methods for solving PDEs, particularly elliptic and parabolic equations, through the use of harmonic functions, Green's functions, and variational principles.

Potential theory is characterized by its deep mathematical beauty and its wide-ranging applications. It illustrates the profound connections between abstract mathematical concepts and concrete physical phenomena, offering a prime example of how mathematical ideas can unify diverse areas of study.
