> Relatedness: The need to feel connected to others and to experience a sense of belonging

### Relatedness

**Relatedness** is one of the three fundamental psychological needs identified in [[Basic Psychological Needs Theory]] (BPNT), a sub-theory of [[Self-Determination Theory]] (SDT) developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. Relatedness refers to the need to feel connected to others, to care for and be cared for by others, and to experience a sense of belonging and attachment to a community.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Relatedness is the psychological need to establish close emotional bonds and attachments with other people, contributing to a sense of belonging and being part of a group.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Emotional Connection**: The desire to form meaningful relationships where one feels understood and accepted.
   - **Social Integration**: Feeling part of a group or community, whether in personal, educational, or professional settings.
   - **Reciprocal Care**: Engaging in relationships where there is mutual care and concern.

3. **Components**:
   - **Belongingness**: The feeling of being an integral part of a group or community.
   - **Attachment**: Emotional bonds with significant others, such as family members, friends, or colleagues.
   - **Social Support**: Receiving and providing support within relationships, contributing to well-being and resilience.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Influence on Well-Being**:
   - **Positive Social Interactions**: Satisfying the need for relatedness through positive interactions enhances emotional well-being and reduces feelings of loneliness and isolation.
   - **Mutual Support**: Engaging in supportive relationships helps individuals cope with stress and challenges, fostering psychological resilience.

2. **Impact on Motivation**:
   - **Intrinsic Motivation**: When individuals feel connected and valued within a community, they are more likely to engage in activities for their inherent satisfaction rather than external rewards.
   - **Internalization**: Satisfying the need for relatedness facilitates the internalization of values and behaviors promoted by the social group, leading to more self-determined motivation.

3. **Development and Maintenance**:
   - **Social Environment**: Environments that provide opportunities for social interaction, collaboration, and mutual support help fulfill the need for relatedness.
   - **Interpersonal Skills**: Developing communication and empathy skills enhances one's ability to form and maintain meaningful relationships.

#### Experimental Evidence

2. **Baumeister and Leary (1995)**:
