A **Morse function** is a smooth function $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ from a manifold $M$ to the real numbers, satisfying certain conditions at its critical points. Specifically, at each critical point (where the derivative of $f$ vanishes), the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second partial derivatives) of $f$ is non-degenerate (its determinant is non-zero). This ensures that the critical points are isolated and that we can classify them according to their indexâ€”the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian.
