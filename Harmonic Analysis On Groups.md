Harmonic analysis on groups is a branch of mathematics that generalizes classical [[Fourier analysis]] from the setting of the real line or the circle to more general groups, especially [[topological groups]]. This field investigates how functions on a group can be represented in terms of basic oscillatory components, akin to how classical Fourier analysis decomposes functions into sums or integrals of sines and cosines. Harmonic analysis on groups is deeply intertwined with the study of representations of groups, the theory of [[special functions]], and applications in physics and engineering.

### Key Concepts and Tools

- **[[Haar Measure]]**: Central to harmonic analysis on groups is the Haar measure, which provides a way to define integration over general topological groups. The Haar measure is invariant under the group action, making it an essential tool for defining and studying various transforms and operators in a manner that respects the group structure.

- **[[Fourier Transform]]**: In the context of groups, the Fourier transform generalizes to take into account the group's structure. For abelian groups, the Fourier transform of a function $f$ on the group maps this function to a function on the dual group (the group of characters of the original group, which are homomorphisms from the group to the unit circle in the complex plane). For non-abelian groups, the notion of the Fourier transform is related to the group's representation theory.

- **[[Representation Theory]]**: This is the study of how a group can act by linear transformations on vector spaces. The representation theory of groups, especially Lie groups, plays a crucial role in harmonic analysis, providing the fundamental building blocks for analyzing functions on the group.

- **[[Peter-Weyl Theorem]]**: This fundamental result in harmonic analysis on compact groups states that square-integrable functions on a compact group can be decomposed into a series of matrix elements of irreducible unitary representations of the group. This theorem generalizes the classical Fourier series expansion and is a cornerstone in the analysis on compact groups.

### Applications

Harmonic analysis on groups has a wide range of applications across mathematics and physics:

- **Quantum Mechanics**: The study of symmetry in quantum systems often utilizes representation theory and harmonic analysis on groups, especially Lie groups that model the symmetries of space and time.

- **Signal Processing**: Generalizations of Fourier analysis are used to process and analyze signals on domains that have a group structure, such as time signals (using the real line group) or images (using rotation and translation groups).

- **Number Theory**: Harmonic analysis on the group of adeles and ideles plays a significant role in modern number theory, including the proof of important results like the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function.

- **Differential Equations**: Solutions to differential equations, especially those that are invariant under the action of a group, can often be analyzed and understood using tools from harmonic analysis.

- **Cryptography**: Certain problems in cryptography, including those related to the structure of finite fields and elliptic curves, can be approached using harmonic analysis.

Harmonic analysis on groups is a rich and active area of research, bridging diverse areas of mathematics and offering powerful tools for understanding the symmetries and structures inherent in various mathematical and physical systems.
