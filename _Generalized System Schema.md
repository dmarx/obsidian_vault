Potential = Capacity for change

Change = measurable difference with respect to a conserved quantity. Change transfers potential into ... "realization", realized value... I dunno



```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


class ConservedQuantity:
	pass


class InteractionClass:
    potential: ConservedQuantity
    metric: Metric
    time_scale: TimeScale
    locality_scale: LocalityScale
    


@dataclass
class System:
    interaction_classes: List[InteractionClass]

```
