**[[Reliability]]** refers to the ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time. In emergent, self-organized systems, reliability is crucial but challenging to ensure due to the decentralized nature of these systems and their dependency on many interacting parts.

- **Robustness and Redundancy**: Robustness in self-organized systems often comes from redundancy and diversity among the components, which can compensate for failures of individual elements. For instance, in ecological systems, biodiversity is a key factor in ecosystem resilience and reliability under environmental stress.

- **Adaptive Capacity**: Self-organized systems often have the inherent capability to adapt to changes and stressors, which enhances their reliability. This adaptive capacity is usually a result of evolutionary processes, feedback mechanisms, and learning behaviors within the system.

- **Impact of Scale**: The scale of interactions can greatly influence reliability. Local failures can sometimes be isolated effectively, but at other times they might cascade through the network. Understanding how local scales relate to global system behavior is crucial in predicting and managing these effects.
