A Survey.
By David Marx

In process:
- Backfill graph topics
	- local graph out to depth = 2 hops
	- outlinks and neighbor links
	- crucially: UNCHECK EXISTING FILES ONLY
		- This is the point of the exercise
	- Goal is identify candidate articles that have been referenced in multiple places or otherwise look relevant.

auto-book/auto-wiki: show local graph, and *propose pages in the local graph*. Add links to proposed nodes to pull them into the 1 step neighborhood. This triggers process to propose the new additions to the two step neighborhood: the 1 step neighborhood around the (previously proposed) newly added node
