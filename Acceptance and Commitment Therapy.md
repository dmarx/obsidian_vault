### Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)** is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that focuses on helping individuals accept their thoughts and feelings rather than fighting or feeling guilty for them. It encourages commitment to personal values and actions that align with these values, promoting psychological flexibility and well-being.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an evidence-based therapeutic approach that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies alongside commitment and behavior change strategies to increase psychological flexibility. It aims to help individuals live a meaningful life while effectively handling the pain and stress that are inevitably part of life.

2. **Core Processes**:
   ACT focuses on six core processes, often represented by the acronym **ACT** (Accept, Choose, and Take action):
   - **[[Acceptance]]**: Embracing thoughts and feelings without trying to change them.
   - **[[Cognitive Defusion]]**: Learning to perceive thoughts and feelings as separate from oneself.
   - **Being Present**: Focusing on the current moment rather than past or future concerns.
   - **[[Self-as-Context]]**: Recognizing a sense of self that is separate from thoughts and feelings.
   - **Values**: Identifying what is truly important to oneself.
   - **Committed Action**: Taking action guided by personal values.

3. **Benefits**:
   - **Increased Psychological Flexibility**: Enhances the ability to adapt to different situations and handle distress effectively.
   - **Improved Mental Health**: Reduces symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress.
   - **Greater Well-Being**: Promotes a sense of fulfillment and life satisfaction by aligning actions with values.
   - **Enhanced Emotional Regulation**: Helps individuals manage and accept their emotions without being overwhelmed by them.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Acceptance**:
   - Encourages individuals to accept their internal experiences, such as thoughts and feelings, instead of avoiding or fighting them.
