>tell me about complex systems theory, dynamical systems, chaos theory, and how these ideas are interrelated (assuming you consider there to be boundaries between these topics)

Complex systems theory, dynamical systems, and chaos theory are closely related areas of study that explore how systems evolve over time and how they exhibit behavior that is both predictable and unpredictable under certain conditions. These fields, while distinct in their focus and approaches, share a common interest in understanding the intricate behaviors of complex systems. Here, we'll explore each area and discuss how they interconnect.

### Complex Systems Theory

[[Complex Systems Theory]] deals with systems that are composed of many interacting components, which can give rise to emergent behavior that is not predictable from the properties of the individual components. These systems are characterized by their high degree of nonlinearity, open environments, and the emergent phenomena that arise from the interactions within the system. Examples of complex systems include ecosystems, economies, and societies.

Key features of complex systems include:
- **Emergence**: The appearance of higher-level properties and behaviors that cannot be deduced directly from the sum of the system's parts.
- **Adaptation**: The ability of elements within the system to change in response to their environment, leading to evolutionary dynamics.
- **Self-organization**: The capacity of a system to develop structures and patterns internally without external command.

### Dynamical Systems

[[Dynamical Systems Theory]] is the mathematical framework used to describe systems that evolve over time according to specific rules. It provides tools for modeling the dynamics of systems that can be deterministic or stochastic in nature. The theory is applied in various fields, including physics, biology, engineering, and economics, to study the behavior of complex systems over time.

Dynamical systems are characterized by:
- **State space**: A mathematical representation of all possible states of a system.
- **Evolution rule**: A rule that describes how the system evolves from one state to another over time.

### Chaos Theory

[[Chaos Theory]] is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditionsâ€”a phenomenon popularly referred to as the "butterfly effect." This sensitivity means that small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes, making long-term prediction impossible in practice, even if the system is deterministic.

Chaos theory highlights:
- **Sensitive dependence on initial conditions**: Small variations in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in outcomes.
- **Fractals**: Structures that exhibit self-similarity across different scales and are often associated with the geometric aspect of chaotic dynamics.
- **Bifurcation**: Points in the parameter space of a system where a small change in parameters can cause a sudden qualitative change in its behavior.

### Interrelations and Boundaries

The boundaries between complex systems theory, dynamical systems, and chaos theory are fluid, as each contributes to understanding different aspects of systems' behavior. Dynamical systems provide the mathematical foundation for modeling the evolution of complex systems, including those that exhibit chaotic behavior. Chaos theory, in turn, focuses on the unpredictability inherent in some dynamical systems, particularly those sensitive to initial conditions.

Complex systems theory encompasses both dynamical and chaotic systems as it seeks to understand the overarching principles that govern the behavior of systems with many interacting components. It's especially concerned with phenomena like emergence and self-organization, which are not exclusively the domain of systems exhibiting chaos but are central to the dynamics of complex systems.

In summary, while there are distinctions between these fields, they are interconnected and often overlap in their study of how systems evolve, interact, and exhibit both predictable and unpredictable behaviors. The integration of insights from complex systems theory, dynamical systems, and chaos theory enriches our understanding of the natural and artificial systems that shape our world.

>what concretely is a "system" in this context? there must be a mathematical formalism here, right?

Yes, within the context of complex systems theory, dynamical systems, and chaos theory, a "system" can be defined in a mathematical and conceptual framework that allows for rigorous analysis and understanding. At its core, a system is a set of interacting components that can be abstracted or represented mathematically in various ways, depending on the nature of the system and the phenomena being studied. The formalism used to describe a system often includes elements such as state spaces, evolution rules (or equations of motion), and parameters that influence the system's behavior.

### Mathematical Formalism of a System

1. **State Space**: The foundation of a mathematical system is its state space, which is a collection of all possible states in which the system can exist. Each state represents a unique configuration of the system's components at a given time. The state space can be finite or infinite, discrete or continuous, depending on the system. In a mathematical context, the state space is often represented by a vector space or a manifold.

2. **Evolution Rule**: This rule, often expressed as a set of equations, describes how the state of the system changes over time. In deterministic systems, a single initial state leads to a unique trajectory through the state space over time. This is typically represented by differential equations or difference equations, depending on whether the system evolves in continuous or discrete time, respectively.

    - For a continuous system, the evolution might be described by a differential equation of the form $eqn\dot{x} = f(x, t)$, where $\dot{x}$ represents the derivative of $x$ with respect to time, indicating how the state changes continuously.
    - For a discrete system, the evolution could be given by a difference equation like $eqn x_{t+1} = f(x_t)$, showing how the state changes at discrete time steps.

3. **Parameters**: Parameters are additional quantities that define specific characteristics of the system and influence its behavior without being considered state variables themselves. Changing a parameter might alter the system's dynamics significantly, potentially leading to phenomena such as bifurcations in dynamical systems.

4. **Initial Conditions**: The specific state from which a system begins its evolution. In systems with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, such as chaotic systems, slight differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly divergent outcomes over time.

### Conceptual Understanding

Beyond the mathematical formalism, a system in these contexts is understood conceptually as an entity composed of parts that interact with each other and possibly with an external environment. These interactions lead to collective behaviors that are often complex and cannot be easily predicted by analyzing the components individually. The study of systems from this perspective focuses on understanding how global behavior emerges from local interactions and how systems evolve and adapt over time.

In summary, a "system" in the context of complex systems theory, dynamical systems, and chaos theory is both a conceptual entity with interacting components and a mathematical model that can be rigorously analyzed to understand its behavior over time. This dual perspective allows researchers to explore and explain the complex behaviors observed in natural and artificial systems.

>in philosophy of math and philosophy of physics, is there any debate or discussion about what defines or characterizes a "system"? or is this mathematical formalism sufficient to satisfy all situations that require a notion of a "system"

In the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of physics, the concept of a "system" indeed prompts discussion and debate, particularly when exploring the foundational aspects of what constitutes a system and how it should be characterized. The mathematical formalism provides a rigorous and practical framework for defining and analyzing systems, especially in the context of science and engineering. However, philosophers often probe deeper into the conceptual underpinnings of what makes something a system, the nature of the relationships between parts and wholes, and the limitations of mathematical formalism in capturing the essence of complex phenomena.

### Debates and Discussions

1. **Ontological Status**: One key area of debate concerns the ontological status of systems. Philosophers question whether systems are real entities in the world or merely conceptual constructs used for the sake of analysis and understanding. This ties into broader philosophical discussions about the nature of reality and how it can be partitioned or classified.

2. **Reductionism vs. Holism**: Another significant debate revolves around reductionism and holism. Reductionism is the view that a system can be fully understood by analyzing its individual components. Holism, on the other hand, posits that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, emphasizing the emergent properties and behaviors that arise from the interactions within a system that cannot be predicted or explained by its individual components alone. Philosophers discuss to what extent mathematical formalisms can capture these emergent properties and whether such formalisms can fully account for the holistic aspects of systems.

3. **Emergence**: The concept of emergence is closely related to the above and is a topic of considerable philosophical interest. There is debate about how emergence should be understood, whether emergent properties are fundamentally different from the properties of parts, and how mathematical models of systems can (or cannot) explain emergent behavior.

4. **Limits of Formalism**: Philosophers also critically examine the limits of mathematical formalism in describing systems. This includes questions about the applicability of models to real-world systems, the challenges of modeling systems with high complexity or open-ended evolution, and the role of simplifications and idealizations in the development of such models.

5. **Contextual Definitions**: In different contexts, what constitutes a "system" might vary, leading to discussions about the adaptability of the definition. For instance, in ecological studies, social sciences, or even in information theory, the notion of a system and what is considered its environment or boundary might differ significantly from more strictly physical or mathematical systems.

### Conclusion

While the mathematical formalism provides a powerful tool for defining and analyzing systems, philosophical discussions extend beyond these formal definitions to explore deeper questions about the nature, representation, and understanding of systems. These debates are important because they influence how theories are interpreted and applied in the real world, how scientific inquiries are framed, and how the limits of scientific knowledge are understood. Philosophical scrutiny helps to clarify these concepts, challenge assumptions, and expand the understanding of what systems are, how they can be studied, and the implications of modeling and representing systems in various domains.

>given everything interacts with everything else, how do we dilineate boundaries between systems?

Delineating boundaries between systems is a fundamental challenge in the study of complex systems, dynamical systems, and chaos theory, as well as in their application across various disciplines. The notion that "everything interacts with everything else" highlights the interconnectedness and interdependence within and across systems, making the task of defining clear boundaries both crucial and difficult. The delineation of system boundaries often involves conceptual, theoretical, and practical considerations, influenced by the goals of the analysis, the nature of the system being studied, and the level of abstraction deemed appropriate.

### Conceptual and Practical Approaches

1. **Purpose of the Study**: The boundaries of a system are often defined based on the objectives of the study or analysis. Researchers decide on the scope of the system by focusing on the elements and interactions most relevant to the questions they seek to answer. This means that the same set of components could be conceptualized as different systems or parts of various systems depending on the research focus.

2. **Scale and Level of Description**: Systems can be analyzed at different scales and levels of description, from microscopic (e.g., molecular or cellular) to macroscopic (e.g., ecological or social systems). Boundaries are drawn to encapsulate the level of detail necessary for the analysis, often isolating the system from its wider context to make the problem tractable.

3. **Interaction Strength and Frequency**: A common criterion for defining system boundaries is the strength and frequency of interactions among components. Components that interact more strongly or frequently with each other than with external entities are often grouped together as part of the same system. This helps in identifying cohesive units that exhibit some degree of autonomy from their environment.

4. **Functional or Operational Criteria**: In some cases, systems are defined by their function or purpose, especially in engineering and organizational contexts. Here, the boundaries are drawn around components that contribute to a specific function or set of operations, distinguishing the system from its external environment based on functional criteria.

5. **Input-Output Relations**: Systems can also be delineated based on their input-output relationships. This approach involves identifying the inputs (resources, information, energy) that the system takes from its environment and the outputs (products, waste, effects) it returns to the environment. The system is then defined by the processes that transform inputs into outputs.

### Philosophical and Theoretical Considerations

1. **Emergence and Holism**: The concepts of emergence and holism suggest that systems exhibit properties and behaviors not evident from their parts in isolation. This perspective supports drawing boundaries at levels where emergent properties become apparent, recognizing systems as entities distinct from the mere aggregation of their components.

2. **Ontological and Epistemological Boundaries**: Philosophical discussions often distinguish between ontological boundaries (concerning the nature of reality and what exists as separate entities) and epistemological boundaries (concerning our knowledge and conceptualization of systems). This distinction highlights that the way we define system boundaries can be influenced by both the inherent properties of the systems and our understanding or modeling of them.

### Conclusion

In practice, delineating boundaries between systems is an iterative and context-dependent process, requiring judgment and adaptation to the specificities of the system under study and the goals of the analysis. The boundaries that researchers or practitioners draw are not always definitive or universally applicable but serve as useful constructs for understanding, analyzing, and managing complex phenomena. Recognizing the provisional and purpose-driven nature of these boundaries is crucial for navigating the complexities of interconnected systems in a coherent and effective manner.

>Ontological and Epistemological Boundaries: Philosophical discussions often distinguish between ontological boundaries (concerning the nature of reality and what exists as separate entities) and epistemological boundaries (concerning our knowledge and conceptualization of systems). This distinction highlights that the way we define system boundaries can be influenced by both the inherent properties of the systems and our understanding or modeling of them.

The distinction between ontological and epistemological boundaries is central to both the philosophy of science and the practical application of scientific theories, especially in the study and management of complex systems. Understanding this distinction helps clarify how we think about, model, and engage with the world. Let's delve deeper into these concepts and their implications.

### Ontological Boundaries

Ontological boundaries concern the nature of reality itself, focusing on what exists as separate entities in the physical world. These boundaries are about the actual segregation of phenomena into distinct systems or entities, independent of human observation or knowledge. In the context of systems theory:

- **Inherent Properties**: The ontological perspective investigates whether systems and their boundaries have inherent properties that exist independently of human perception. This includes considering whether systems can be objectively delineated based on natural divisions in the world.
- **Reality of Systems**: It questions the real versus conceptual nature of systems. Are systems real entities in the universe, or are they constructs developed by observers to understand the complexity of the world?

### Epistemological Boundaries

Epistemological boundaries, on the other hand, concern our knowledge and conceptualization of systems. They are about how we define, understand, and represent systems within our cognitive and theoretical frameworks. This includes:

- **Modeling and Representation**: How do our models and theories represent the divisions among systems? This involves the processes of abstraction and simplification to make complex realities understandable and manageable within our cognitive limits.
- **Observer Influence**: The recognition that our observations, theories, and tools shape our understanding of systems and their boundaries. It implies that different observers or different scientific paradigms might conceptualize the boundaries of the same system in diverse ways.

### Interplay and Implications

The interplay between ontological and epistemological boundaries has profound implications for science, philosophy, and the management of complex systems:

1. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: Acknowledging that some system boundaries may be more epistemological than ontological highlights the role of subjectivity and theoretical frameworks in science. This recognition encourages a more reflective and critical approach to the assumptions underlying scientific models.

2. **Adaptability of Boundaries**: Understanding that boundaries can be both ontological and epistemological supports the notion that system boundaries may need to be adapted as our knowledge or the context changes. This adaptability is crucial in fields like ecology, social sciences, and economics, where systems are highly complex and interdependent.

3. **Interdisciplinary Communication**: The distinction fosters better communication and collaboration across disciplines. By recognizing that different fields may conceptualize boundaries differently due to their epistemological foundations, researchers can bridge gaps in understanding and methodology.

4. **Practical Applications**: In practical terms, distinguishing between these types of boundaries can aid in the design and implementation of interventions in complex systems. For instance, in environmental management or organizational design, understanding the difference between the inherent divisions within a system and those imposed for analytical convenience can lead to more effective strategies.

In summary, the distinction between ontological and epistemological boundaries enriches our understanding of systems and their study. It serves as a reminder of the complexity of the natural world and the nuanced role of human cognition and methodology in shaping our understanding of it. Recognizing this distinction allows for a more nuanced, flexible, and reflective approach to studying and interacting with systems in a variety of fields.

>what are some of the prevailing ideas in the modern philosophical debate regarding the epistemological and ontological dilineation of system boundaries/components?

The modern philosophical debate regarding the epistemological and ontological delineation of system boundaries and components engages with several prevailing ideas and challenges. These discussions are pivotal in fields such as the philosophy of science, environmental philosophy, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy, reflecting broader concerns about how we understand complex entities and their interactions. Here's an overview of some key ideas and debates:

### Realism vs. Constructivism

- **Realism** posits that systems and their boundaries have an existence and properties that are independent of human thought and observation. From this perspective, the goal of science and philosophy is to discover and describe these objective realities. Realists argue that ontological boundaries are "out there" in the world, waiting to be uncovered.
  
- **Constructivism** suggests that our understanding of systems and their boundaries is constructed through social and cognitive processes. Constructivists emphasize that what we know about systems is shaped by human perception, language, and social practices. This view tends to focus on epistemological boundaries, arguing that our knowledge of systems is contingent upon these factors.

### Systems Theory and Cybernetics

- Modern systems theory and cybernetics contribute significantly to this debate, offering a framework that blurs the traditional boundaries between observer and observed, and between systems and their environments. These fields explore how feedback loops and information flows contribute to the self-organization and regulation of systems, suggesting that boundaries might be fluid and context-dependent.

### Emergence

- The concept of **emergence** is central to discussions about system boundaries. Philosophers debate whether emergent properties (which arise from the interactions within a system but are not reducible to the properties of the system's components) suggest a fundamental ontological category that challenges traditional notions of part-whole relations. This has implications for how systems are defined and understood, both ontologically and epistemologically.

### Environmental Philosophy

- In environmental philosophy, the delineation of system boundaries is a pressing issue, particularly in the context of ecological systems and human-environment interactions. Questions arise about where to draw the line between a natural system and human influences, and whether such distinctions are ontologically real or constructed for the sake of analysis and intervention.

### Social Systems and Boundaries

- The delineation of boundaries in social systems prompts debates around social constructs, power dynamics, and the material versus the symbolic aspects of social life. Philosophers and social theorists explore how social, economic, and political boundaries are drawn and maintained, and the extent to which these boundaries are ontological (reflecting material realities) or epistemological (reflecting our understanding or interpretation of social realities).

### Philosophy of Mind and Consciousness

- In the philosophy of mind, questions about the boundaries of consciousness and the mind-body problem intersect with these debates. The delineation between mental states, physical brain states, and the external world involves both ontological questions (about the nature of consciousness) and epistemological ones (about our knowledge of consciousness).

### Challenges of Interdisciplinarity

- The interdisciplinary nature of systems thinking introduces challenges in integrating diverse perspectives on system boundaries. Different disciplines may adopt varying ontological and epistemological stances, leading to rich debates about how best to understand complex phenomena that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.

### Conclusion

The modern philosophical debate around the delineation of system boundaries and components reflects a dynamic interplay between theories about the nature of reality and our ways of knowing that reality. These discussions are not merely academic; they have practical implications for how we approach complex problems in science, ethics, environmental management, and social policy. Understanding and navigating these debates requires an appreciation for the complexity of systems and a willingness to engage with multiple perspectives on their boundaries and components.

>tell me more about the dilineation of system boundaries/components in contemporary philosophy of mind. I have a graduate degree in philosophy, please don't hesitate to get technical. focus on developments from the last 20 or so years, curious about recent developments

In contemporary philosophy of mind, the delineation of system boundaries and components has been a focal point of intense debate and innovative thinking, particularly as philosophers grapple with the complexities of consciousness, cognition, and the mind-body problem. Developments in the last two decades have seen a significant shift toward more nuanced, integrated, and sometimes radical approaches to understanding the mind and its place in the natural world. Below are key areas where recent philosophical inquiry has concentrated:

### Extended Mind and Externalism

One of the most influential ideas in recent years is the **Extended Mind Thesis** (EMT), proposed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers in the late 1990s and further developed in subsequent works. The EMT challenges traditional boundaries of the mind by arguing that cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain to include the body and the environment. Tools, technologies, and even social structures can become so integrated with our cognitive processes that they can rightly be considered part of the mind. This perspective has encouraged philosophers to rethink the boundaries between mind, body, and world, suggesting a more networked and distributed conception of cognition.

### Enactivism and Embodied Cognition

Enactivism and theories of **Embodied Cognition** offer another avenue through which the delineation of system boundaries in the philosophy of mind has been explored. These theories emphasize the role of the body in shaping and constituting mental processes, arguing against the Cartesian dualism that separates mind and body. From this viewpoint, cognition is seen as arising from the dynamic interactions between an organism and its environment, with consciousness being rooted in these embodied actions. Philosophers like Evan Thompson and Francisco Varela have been instrumental in developing this perspective, pushing for a deeper understanding of how consciousness emerges from the active engagement of living systems with their surroundings.

### Panpsychism and Constitutive Micropsychism

In addressing the hard problem of consciousness, some contemporary philosophers have turned to **Panpsychism**, the view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world. This perspective posits that even the simplest forms of matter possess some form of experiential quality, challenging traditional ontological boundaries between conscious entities and inanimate matter. Philip Goff and Galen Strawson are notable proponents of this view, advocating for a form of **Constitutive Micropsychism**, which suggests that human consciousness emerges from the combination and organization of simpler forms of consciousness present in the components of the brain.

### Predictive Processing and the Free Energy Principle

Recent developments in cognitive science and the philosophy of mind have also been influenced by theories of **Predictive Processing** and the **Free Energy Principle**. These frameworks propose that the brain is fundamentally engaged in minimizing the discrepancy between its predictions about sensory inputs and the inputs themselves. Philosophers like Jakob Hohwy and Andy Clark have explored how these theories alter our understanding of the boundaries between perception, cognition, and action, suggesting that the mind is constantly involved in constructing and updating its model of the world, blurring the lines between internal cognitive processes and external reality.

### Information Integration Theory and Tononi's Phi

Giulio Tononi's **Information Integration Theory (IIT)** of consciousness proposes a quantitative measure of consciousness called "phi," which aims to capture the degree of information integration within a system. This theory provides a framework for understanding consciousness in terms of the intrinsic causal powers of a system, offering a potential basis for delineating the boundaries of conscious entities. IIT challenges conventional notions by suggesting that any system capable of high levels of information integration may possess consciousness, pushing the boundaries of what entities might be considered conscious.

### Conclusion

The last two decades in the philosophy of mind have seen a proliferation of theories that challenge and expand the traditional boundaries of mental states, consciousness, and the self. By integrating insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, and phenomenology, contemporary philosophers have developed a richer, more interconnected view of the mind that emphasizes its embodiment, extension, and emergence from complex interactions. These developments reflect a broader trend in contemporary philosophy toward questioning and redefining the boundaries of complex systems, whether they are minds, organisms, or ecosystems.

---

In contemporary philosophy of mind, the delineation of system boundaries and components has been influenced by several significant developments over the last two decades. These developments reflect broader shifts towards understanding the mind in a more interconnected, less individualistic manner, challenging traditional notions of mental processes as being solely within the brain. Here, I'll outline key areas where recent philosophical inquiry has focused on the boundaries and components of cognitive systems.

### Embedded and Embodied Cognition

The theories of embedded and embodied cognition argue against the traditional view that cognitive processes are confined within the boundaries of the skull. Instead, these perspectives propose that cognitive systems extend into the body and the environment.

- **Embedded Cognition** emphasizes that cognitive processes depend heavily on the external environment. This view suggests that tools, symbols, and other environmental factors play integral roles in cognitive processing, effectively blurring the boundaries between the mind and the external world.
  
- **Embodied Cognition** goes further by arguing that cognition is deeply influenced by the body's interactions with its environment. This perspective highlights the role of sensorimotor capacities in shaping cognitive processes, suggesting a system boundary that encompasses both the body and its situated context.

### Enactivism

Enactivism presents a radical rethinking of cognition that emphasizes the co-constitutive relationship between an organism and its environment. It argues that cognitive processes emerge from the dynamic interactions between an agent and its environment, leading to a view of mind as enacted through these interactions rather than pre-existing in a delimited neural substrate.

- This perspective challenges clear-cut ontological and epistemological boundaries between the mind, body, and world, proposing instead that cognition is a process of bringing forth meaning through engagement with the world. Enactivism posits a deeply interconnected system where the delineation of boundaries is fluid and context-dependent.

### Extended Mind Theory

The Extended Mind Thesis (EMT), proposed by Clark and Chalmers in the late 1990s and further developed in subsequent years, argues that cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain to include external devices and environmental features, provided that these external elements play a significant, reliable role in the individual's cognitive life.

- EMT challenges traditional ontological assumptions about the boundaries of the cognitive system, suggesting that objects in the environment can become parts of the cognitive process itself if they are sufficiently integrated into the agent's cognitive routines.
  
- This thesis has sparked debates about the criteria for including external components within the cognitive system's boundaries, focusing on issues of coupling, reliability, and information flow between the agent and external elements.

### 4E Cognition

Building on these theories, the framework of 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended) represents a comprehensive shift towards viewing cognition as a process that transcends the brain-body boundary, incorporating elements of the environment and the agent's interactions with it.

- This approach has encouraged philosophers to explore new ways of conceptualizing system boundaries that account for the dynamic, interactive nature of cognitive processes. The 4E framework challenges the epistemological boundaries drawn by traditional cognitive science and philosophy of mind, advocating for a more integrated understanding of cognition.

### Information Integration and Network Theories

Recent developments in neuroscience, such as information integration theory (IIT) and network theories of brain function, have influenced philosophical discussions about the boundaries and components of cognitive systems. These theories suggest that consciousness and cognitive processes emerge from the integrated information processing within networks that span various brain regions.

- Philosophical interpretations of these theories often grapple with questions about the physical substrates of cognition, the role of neural plasticity in defining system boundaries, and how information integration can occur across distributed networks. These discussions intersect with philosophical inquiries about the nature of consciousness and its relation to the material world.

### Conclusion

In the last 20 years, contemporary philosophy of mind has increasingly questioned and redefined the boundaries and components of cognitive systems. Through the lenses of embedded, embodied, enactive, and extended cognition, as well as advances in understanding brain networks, philosophers have challenged traditional views of cognition as a brain-bound process. These developments reflect a broader move towards a more holistic, interconnected understanding of mind, emphasizing the importance of bodily and environmental interactions in cognitive processes.
