A **Voronoi Diagram** is a fundamental construct in computational geometry that partitions a plane into regions based on distance to a specified set of points. Named after the Russian mathematician Georgy Voronoy, these diagrams are widely used in various fields such as meteorology, biology, mining, urban planning, and robotics.

### Definition
Given a set of distinct points $P = \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the Voronoi diagram partitions $\mathbb{R}^d$ into regions called Voronoi cells. Each cell, associated with a point $p_i$, consists of every point in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose distance to $p_i$ is less than or equal to its distance to any other $p_j$ in $P$.

### Mathematical Formulation
For each point $p_i \in P$, the Voronoi cell, denoted as $V(p_i)$, can be expressed as:
$$
V(p_i) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d : \| x - p_i \| \leq \| x - p_j \|, \forall j \neq i \}
$$
Here, $\| \cdot \|$ typically denotes the Euclidean distance, although other metrics can be used depending on the application.

### Properties
1. **[[Convexity]]**: Each Voronoi cell is a convex set.
2. **[[Decomposition]]**: The union of all Voronoi cells covers the entire space without overlap (except possibly on the boundaries between cells).
3. **Duality to Delaunay Triangulation**: There is a dual relationship between the Voronoi diagram and the [[Delaunay Triangulation]] for the same set of points. Each edge in the Voronoi diagram is perpendicular to and bisects the edge of the Delaunay triangulation connecting the points whose cells share the edge.

### Algorithms for Construction
Several algorithms exist for constructing Voronoi diagrams, with the most common being:
- **Fortune's Algorithm**: A sweep-line algorithm that runs in $O(n \log n)$ time, making it efficient for planar diagrams.
- **Incremental Algorithms**: Insert points one at a time and update the diagram accordingly.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Split the points into subsets, construct the diagrams for each subset, and merge the results.

### Applications
Voronoi diagrams have a wide range of applications across various disciplines:
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**: Used for nearest neighbor queries, allocating resources in spatial planning, and defining regions for municipal services.
- **Biology**: Modeling the growth patterns of forests and diseases.
- **Robotics**: Space partitioning for navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Telecommunications**: Designing coverage areas for cell towers.

### Visual Example
In a two-dimensional space with points representing cities, the Voronoi diagram would show regions around each city such that any location within a region is closer to its corresponding city than to any other city. This can visually represent service areas or influence zones.

### Further Exploration
For those interested in the computational aspects and further applications of Voronoi diagrams, it can be enlightening to explore how these diagrams interact with other geometrical structures, like the already mentioned [[Delaunay Triangulation]], or to delve into applications in machine learning and data science where they help with clustering and classification problems. Additionally, extending Voronoi concepts to higher dimensions or different metrics can open up new perspectives and challenges in both theoretical and applied contexts.
