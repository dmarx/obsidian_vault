- **[[Continuity]] in [[Metric Space|Metric Spaces]]:** A function between metric spaces is continuous if and only if it preserves the structure of [[open sets]] as defined by their metrics. More precisely, a function $f: (X, d_X) \rightarrow (Y, d_Y)$ is continuous if the preimage of every open set in $Y$ is an open set in $X$. This definition aligns with the epsilon-delta definition of continuity in metric spaces, highlighting the deep connection between metrics and topology.
