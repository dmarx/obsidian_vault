The concept of "Loss of Autonomy" in socio-economic contexts often refers to a reduction in individuals' control over their work and lives due to external pressures, economic shifts, or structural changes in society. This phenomenon is particularly significant in discussions of proletariatization, where individuals transition from being self-employed or managing their own means of production, to working as wage laborers under conditions set by employers. This concept can be analyzed from various perspectives, including economic, psychological, and sociological angles.

### Economic Perspective

From an economic standpoint, loss of autonomy is often manifested through:
- **Control over Production**: Transition from owning tools and resources needed for production (e.g., land, machinery) to working with employer-owned resources, where the employer dictates the terms of use and production goals.
- **Work Conditions**: Shift from self-regulated work schedules and practices to structured, often rigid, work conditions imposed by an employer, including hours, pace, and methods of work.
- **Economic Dependence**: Increased reliance on wages provided by others for livelihood, as opposed to earnings from personal production or trade.

$$\text{Autonomy Index} = \frac{\text{Personal Control over Work Conditions + Economic Independence}}{\text{Total Economic Activity}}$$

### Psychological Perspective

Psychologically, loss of autonomy can lead to:
- **Alienation**: A sense of disconnection from the work one does and its outcomes, leading to feelings of dissatisfaction and estrangement from one's labor.
- **Reduced Job Satisfaction**: Decreased control over work can lead to lower job satisfaction and a diminished sense of personal achievement.
- **Stress and Anxiety**: Lack of autonomy in work settings can increase stress and anxiety, impacting mental health negatively.

### Sociological Perspective

Sociologically, the loss of autonomy impacts community and societal structures:
- **Class Dynamics**: As more people become dependent wage earners, class distinctions may become more pronounced, influencing social mobility and equity.
- **Social Relations**: Changes in work dynamics can alter family roles and community interactions, with potential decreases in social cohesion and increased individualization.

### Formalization in Sociological Analysis

In sociological terms, the loss of autonomy can be quantitatively assessed through changes in social indices and qualitative analyses of societal shifts. For instance:

$$\text{Autonomy Coefficient} = \frac{\text{Number of Self-employed Individuals}}{\text{Total Working Population}}$$

This coefficient might decrease as proletariatization processes intensify in a given economy, reflecting broader socio-economic transformations.

The study of autonomy is crucial for understanding broader socio-economic transformations and their impacts on individual and collective well-being.
