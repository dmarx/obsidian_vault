Global bifurcations are phenomena in dynamical systems where the qualitative structure of the entire phase space changes. Unlike local bifurcations, which involve changes in the stability or number of equilibrium points or periodic orbits near those equilibria, global bifurcations involve changes that affect the global topology of trajectories in the phase space. Key examples of global bifurcations include homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations.
