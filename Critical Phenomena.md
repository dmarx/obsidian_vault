Critical phenomena refer to the peculiar behavior of physical systems near continuous phase transitions, also known as second-order phase transitions. At these critical points, a system undergoes dramatic changes in its physical properties, and these changes are characterized by universal features that are largely independent of the system's microscopic details. The study of critical phenomena encompasses a broad range of systems across physics, chemistry, and materials science, including the transition between liquid and gas phases, magnetization in ferromagnetic materials, and superconductivity.

### Key Features of Critical Phenomena

1. **[[Critical Points]]:** This is the point at which the phase transition occurs. For example, at the critical point of a liquid-gas transition, the distinction between the liquid and gas phases disappears.

2. **[[Order Parameter]]:** An order parameter is a quantity that measures the degree of order across the transition. For a magnet, the order parameter could be the net magnetization, which goes to zero as the system approaches the critical temperature from below.

3. **Divergence of [[Correlation Length]]:** Near the critical point, fluctuations occur over all length scales, and the correlation length $\xi$, which measures the size over which particles or spins are correlated, diverges. Mathematically, $\xi \sim |T-T_c|^{-\nu}$, where $T$ is the temperature, $T_c$ is the critical temperature, and $\nu$ is a critical exponent.

4. **[[Critical Exponents]] and [[Scaling Laws]]:** Critical exponents describe how physical quantities behave near the critical point. They are universal in the sense that they depend only on the dimensionality of the system and the symmetry of the order parameter, not on the microscopic details of the system. Critical exponents define scaling laws that describe how quantities like the order parameter, susceptibility, and specific heat change as the system approaches the critical point.

### Mathematical Formalism

The behavior of systems near critical points can be described by the [[Renormalization Group Theory]], which provides a framework for understanding the changes in physical systems as one zooms in or out on different length scales. RG theory explains the universality of critical phenomena and the values of critical exponents through the concept of [[fixed points]] and [[Flows|flow]] in the space of Hamiltonians or [[Free Energy Functionals]].

The [[Landau theory]] of phase transitions provides another approach to describing critical phenomena. It involves expanding the free energy as a power series in the order parameter and its gradients. While Landau theory correctly predicts the existence of phase transitions and offers insights into symmetry breaking, it does not accurately predict critical exponents because it neglects fluctuations, which become crucial near the critical point.

### Examples and Applications

- **Liquid-Gas Transition:** Near the critical point, the distinction between liquid and gas vanishes, leading to the phenomenon of critical opalescence, where the fluid becomes milky because of large density fluctuations.

- **Magnetism:** In ferromagnetic materials, the Curie point marks the critical temperature above which the material loses its spontaneous magnetization.

- **Superconductors and Superfluids:** These systems also exhibit critical phenomena as they transition into their superconducting or superfluid phases.

### Implications

The study of critical phenomena has profound implications for our understanding of phase transitions and the collective behavior of systems. It has influenced fields beyond traditional physics, including financial markets, traffic flow, and even neuroscience, through the application of concepts like [[scale invariance]] and [[universality]]. The insights gained from critical phenomena highlight the power of symmetry and scaling arguments in explaining the natural world, emphasizing the deep connections between seemingly disparate systems.
