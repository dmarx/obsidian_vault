Rushbrooke's equality is one of the fundamental scaling laws in the field of [[critical phenomena]] and [[phase transitions]], providing a relationship among the critical exponents that describe how specific physical quantities diverge or vanish near a critical point. These critical exponents characterize the behavior of the system as it approaches the critical temperature \(T_c\) from above or below.

The [[critical exponents]] involved in Rushbrooke's equality are:
- \(\alpha\), which describes the divergence of the specific heat \(C\) near the critical point as \(C \sim |T - T_c|^{-\alpha}\),
- \(\beta\), which characterizes the behavior of the order parameter \(M\) (e.g., magnetization in a magnetic system) as \(M \sim (T_c - T)^\beta\) for \(T < T_c\), and
- \(\gamma\), which describes the divergence of the susceptibility \(\chi\) (e.g., magnetic susceptibility) as \(\chi \sim |T - T_c|^{-\gamma}\).

### Rushbrooke's Equality

Rushbrooke's equality states that the critical exponents \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) are not independent but are related by the equation:

\[ \alpha + 2\beta + \gamma = 2 \]

This relationship is derived under the assumption of scale invariance near the critical point and is supported by the hypothesis of a homogeneous and universal free energy function in the vicinity of \(T_c\).

### Implications and Significance

- **Universality**: Rushbrooke's equality highlights the concept of universality in critical phenomena, implying that the sum of these exponents is the same for a wide variety of physical systems belonging to the same universality class. This means that despite the microscopic differences between systems, their macroscopic critical behavior can be described by the same set of critical exponents.
- **Experimental and Theoretical Verification**: Rushbrooke's equality provides a means to experimentally verify the theoretical predictions of critical exponents. If the measured values of \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) satisfy this equality, it supports the theoretical models used to describe the critical phenomena in the system under study.
- **Constraint on Exponents**: By establishing a relationship between three critical exponents, Rushbrooke's equality serves as a constraint that any theoretical model or numerical simulation must satisfy to be considered valid for describing systems in the corresponding universality class.

### Beyond Rushbrooke's Equality

Rushbrooke's equality is part of a set of scaling laws that include other relationships among critical exponents, such as [[Widom's scaling law]] (\(\gamma = \beta(\delta - 1)\)) and[[ Fisher's scaling law]] (\(\gamma = \nu(2 - \eta)\)). These scaling laws all stem from the assumption of a universal scaling form of the free energy near the critical point and are fundamental to the study of critical phenomena, reinforcing the concept of universality across different physical systems.
