### Identified Regulation

**Identified Regulation** is a type of extrinsic motivation described in [[Organismic Integration Theory]] (OIT), a sub-theory of [[Self-Determination Theory]] (SDT) developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. Identified regulation occurs when individuals consciously value a goal or behavior, recognizing it as personally important and aligning it with their own values and beliefs. This form of regulation is more autonomous and self-determined than other forms of extrinsic motivation, such as [[Introjected Regulation]].

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Identified regulation refers to the process where individuals identify with the value of a behavior or goal, accepting it as their own and engaging in the behavior willingly because it is seen as personally important and meaningful.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Personal Endorsement**: Individuals accept and endorse the behavior or goal as personally significant.
   - **Conscious Valuing**: The behavior is aligned with oneâ€™s personal values and goals, even if the activity itself is not inherently enjoyable.
   - **Autonomous Motivation**: Actions are taken out of personal choice and volition, not due to external pressures or obligations.

3. **Examples**:
   - A student studies hard because they value education and recognize its importance for their future career.
   - An employee works on a challenging project because they see it as a valuable opportunity for personal and professional growth.
   - An individual exercises regularly because they understand and appreciate the health benefits.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Autonomy and Self-Determination**:
   - Identified regulation enhances autonomy as individuals engage in behaviors that are congruent with their personal goals and values.

2. **Internalization Process**:
   - The behavior or goal is internalized and recognized as valuable, moving closer to intrinsic motivation on the self-determination continuum.

#### Theoretical Framework

1. **Motivational Continuum**:
   - In the SDT framework, identified regulation is more self-determined than external and introjected regulation but less so than integrated and intrinsic motivation:
     - **External Regulation**: Behavior is driven by external rewards or punishments.
     - **Introjected Regulation**: Behavior is driven by internal pressures.
     - **Identified Regulation**: Behavior is aligned with personal goals and values.
     - **Integrated Regulation**: Behavior is fully assimilated with the self.
     - **Intrinsic Motivation**: Behavior is engaged in for its inherent enjoyment and satisfaction.

2. **Autonomy Spectrum**:
   - Identified regulation is positioned towards the more autonomous end of the spectrum, indicating a higher degree of self-determination.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, and Leone (1994)**:
   - **Experiment**: Tested the effects of autonomy support on internalization.
   - **Results**: Participants who received autonomy support showed greater identification with and integration of the activity compared to those in controlling conditions.

2. **Williams, Grow, Freedman, Ryan, and Deci (1996)**:
   - **Study**: Investigated autonomous motivation in health behaviors.
   - **Results**: Patients with identified regulation for health behaviors (e.g., understanding the importance of exercise) were more likely to maintain these behaviors over time.

3. **Vansteenkiste, Simons, Lens, Sheldon, and Deci (2004)**:
   - **Study**: Examined students' motivation for learning.
   - **Results**: Found that identified regulation was associated with higher quality learning, deeper engagement, and better academic performance.

#### Mathematical Formalization

To formalize identified regulation, consider a model that captures the degree of internalization and personal endorsement:

1. **Motivational Continuum**:
   - Let $M$ represent the level of motivation, ranging from $M_{am}$ (amotivation) to $M_{in}$ (intrinsic motivation), with intermediate levels representing various forms of extrinsic motivation ($M_{ex}$).

2. **Internalization Process**:
   - The probability of internalizing an external regulation $E$ into identified regulation $I$ can be modeled as:
   $$
   P(I \mid E) = f(A, C, R)
   $$
   where $A$, $C$, and $R$ represent the satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, respectively, and $f$ is a function reflecting the internalization process.

3. **Degree of Self-Determination**:
   - The degree of self-determination $D$ associated with a behavior can be expressed as a weighted sum of its regulatory components:
   $$
   D = w_{ex}M_{ex} + w_{id}M_{id}
   $$
   where $w_{ex}$ and $w_{id}$ are weights representing the extent to which behavior is extrinsically regulated or identified, respectively.

#### Implications

1. **Education**:
   - **Teaching Practices**: Educators should focus on helping students see the personal relevance and value of their learning activities, fostering identified regulation.

2. **Workplace**:
   - **Management Practices**: Employers should communicate the importance and personal relevance of tasks and projects, helping employees internalize organizational goals.

3. **Healthcare**:
   - **Patient Motivation**: Healthcare providers should emphasize the personal health benefits of behaviors to promote identified regulation and long-term adherence.
