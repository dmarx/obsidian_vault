# Work and Power in Neural Network Training

## 1. Thermodynamic Work

### 1.1 Work Done During Training
Total work has multiple components:

```
W_total = W_useful + W_dissipative
```

Where:
- W_useful: Information-theoretic minimum work to encode learning
- W_dissipative: Heat dissipated during computation

### 1.2 Useful Work (Landauer Bound)
Minimum work to encode one bit of information:
```
W_useful_per_bit = k_B T ln(2)
```

For parameter updates:
```
W_useful = k_B T ΔS_information
```
where ΔS_information is information gain in parameters

### 1.3 Dissipative Work
From gradient computations:
```
W_dissipative = ∫ F·dθ = ∫ η|∇L(θ)|²dt
```

## 2. Power Analysis

### 2.1 Instantaneous Power
```
P(t) = dW/dt = P_compute + P_memory + P_communication
```

### 2.2 Computational Power
```
P_compute = ν₀ * N_params * (E_FLOP + T * ΔS_per_op)
```
where:
- E_FLOP is energy per operation
- ΔS_per_op is entropy generation per operation

### 2.3 Memory Power
```
P_memory = f_memory * N_params * E_mem_access
```
where:
- f_memory is memory access frequency
- E_mem_access is energy per memory access

## 3. Efficiency Metrics

### 3.1 Thermodynamic Efficiency
```
η_thermo = W_useful/W_total
        = ΔS_information/(ΔS_information + ΔS_dissipative)
```

### 3.2 Power Efficiency
```
η_power = Information_gained/Energy_spent
       = ΔI/(P_total * Δt)
```

## 4. Work-Loss Trade-offs

### 4.1 Work-Loss Relationship
```
L(θ) - L* ≥ (T/2)log(W_min/W_actual)
```

### 4.2 Optimal Work Path
Minimum work path follows:
```
dW_opt = T * |∇S_information|* |dθ|
```

## 5. Power-Speed Trade-offs

### 5.1 Speed Limit from Power
For fixed power budget P_max:
```
ν₀_max = P_max/(N_params * E_FLOP)
```

### 5.2 Training Time vs Power
```
t_train ≥ ΔS_information * k_B T ln(2)/P_max
```

## 6. Optimization Under Constraints

### 6.1 Fixed Energy Budget
For total energy budget E_budget:
```
∫P(t)dt ≤ E_budget
```

Optimal batch size:
```
B_opt = √(E_budget * η_power/(ν₀ * t_train))
```

### 6.2 Fixed Power Budget
Under P_max constraint:
```
ν₀ * B ≤ P_max/(N_params * E_FLOP)
```

### 6.3 Fixed Time Budget
Under t_max constraint:
```
P_min = ΔS_information * k_B T ln(2)/t_max
```

## 7. Energy Landscapes

### 7.1 Work Done Against Gradient
```
W_gradient = ∫|∇L(θ)|* |dθ|
```

### 7.2 Heat Dissipation
```
Q = W_total - ΔF
```
where ΔF is free energy change

## 8. Practical Implications

### 8.1 Energy-Aware Training
Optimal power schedule:
```
P(t) = P_max * (1 - t/t_train)^(1/2)
```

### 8.2 Work-Optimal Learning Rate
```
η_opt = min(1/L, P_max/(ν₀ * N_params * |∇L|²))
```

### 8.3 Energy-Efficient Batch Size
```
B_efficient = √(P_max * η_power/(ν₀ * E_FLOP))
```

## 9. Work-Information Balance

### 9.1 Information-Work Principle
```
I_gained ≤ W_total/(k_B T ln(2))
```

### 9.2 Optimal Work Distribution
```
dW/dt ∝ |∇I(θ,t)|
```

where I(θ,t) is Fisher information

### 9.3 Power-Limited Learning Rate
```
dI/dt ≤ P_max/(k_B T ln(2))
```
