Marvin Minsky, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, contributed significantly to the understanding of how intelligence could emerge from the interactions of non-intelligent parts. His concept of the "[[Society of Mind]]" theorizes that minds are systems of interacting parts (which he called [[Agency|agents]]) that can give rise to intelligent behavior. This theory aligns with the principles of emergence and self-organization, positing that [[Consciousness]] and [[Intelligence]] do not reside in any single part of the brain but [[Emergence|emerge]] from the complex interactions of simpler, unintelligent components. Minsky's work has influenced the development of modular and hierarchical approaches to AI, reflecting the idea that complex behaviors can emerge from the aggregation and interaction of simple modules.
