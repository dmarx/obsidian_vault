One of the primary mathematical frameworks used to model dissipative structures is through reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs) that combine chemical reactions (transformation of substances) with diffusion (spatial distribution and movement of substances).

- **General Formulation:** A reaction-diffusion system can typically be described by equations of the form:
  \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 u + f(u, v, \dots) \]
  where \(u\) represents the concentration of a substance, \(D\) is the diffusion coefficient, \(\nabla^2\) is the Laplace operator indicating diffusion, and \(f(u, v, \dots)\) represents the reaction terms involving the concentrations of substances.

- **Examples:** The [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky Reaction]], modeling predator-prey interactions in ecology, and pattern formation in biological organisms are examples where reaction-diffusion models have been applied.
