## Supernormal Stimulus

A **supernormal stimulus** is an exaggerated version of a stimulus to which there is an existing behavioral response. This concept, rooted in ethology, highlights how certain artificial enhancements can elicit stronger responses from animals (including humans) than the natural stimuli to which they are naturally adapted.

### Historical Context

The concept of supernormal stimulus was first introduced by the Dutch ethologist [[Niko Tinbergen]]. Tinbergen, along with [[Konrad Lorenz]], conducted foundational research demonstrating how animals could be triggered by exaggerated stimuli. For instance, Tinbergen observed that certain birds, like the oystercatcher, would prefer to sit on larger artificial eggs than on their actual eggs. Similarly, Lorenz found that some fish would react more aggressively to a larger-than-normal model of a rival male.

### Mechanism

The phenomenon of supernormal stimuli can be understood through the principles of stimulus-response mechanisms in behavioral science. These mechanisms are typically based on the following key points:

1. **Innate Releasing Mechanisms (IRMs)**: Animals possess IRMs that are activated by specific external stimuli. For example, the red spot on the beak of a herring gull chick’s parent is a trigger for the chick to peck at the parent’s beak, prompting feeding.

2. **Exaggeration Effect**: When these stimuli are artificially exaggerated, they can trigger a disproportionately strong response. This is because the IRMs are tuned to respond to the intensity or prominence of certain features in the stimulus.

### Examples

#### Animal Behavior

1. **Birds**: Many birds are known to prefer larger eggs. When given the choice between their own eggs and significantly larger artificial ones, they often choose the latter, even though the artificial eggs are not viable.

2. **Fish**: Male stickleback fish, which have a red belly during mating season, will exhibit aggressive behavior towards objects with exaggerated red coloration, mistaking them for rival males.

3. **Insects**: Certain butterflies and moths are attracted to flowers based on their color and nectar. Artificial flowers with exaggerated colors or larger nectar quantities can draw more attention from these insects.

#### Human Behavior

Humans are also susceptible to supernormal stimuli. Examples include:

1. **Food**: Highly processed foods are often engineered to be more appealing than natural foods by exaggerating flavors, sweetness, or fat content, leading to overconsumption.

2. **Media**: Bright colors, loud sounds, and fast-moving images in media can capture human attention more effectively than natural scenes, which can lead to prolonged screen time.

3. **Body Image**: Media portrayals of exaggerated physical features can distort perceptions of attractiveness, leading individuals to prefer unrealistic body images.

### Mathematical Formalization

To formalize the concept, consider a response function $R(S)$ that describes the behavioral response to a stimulus $S$. In the context of a supernormal stimulus, we can define:

$$
R(S) = f(I(S))
$$

where \(I(S)\) is the intensity of the stimulus, and \(f\) is a response function. In many cases, \(f\) is monotonically increasing, meaning that as the intensity \(I(S)\) increases, so does the response \(R(S)\). 

For a supernormal stimulus $S'$, where $I(S') > I(S)$ for a normal stimulus \(S\):

$$
R(S') > R(S)
$$

This inequality indicates that the response to the supernormal stimulus \(S'\) is greater than the response to the normal stimulus \(S\).

### Implications

The study of supernormal stimuli has profound implications for understanding behavior, both in animals and humans. It reveals how evolutionary adaptations can be co-opted by artificial enhancements, leading to behaviors that might be maladaptive in contemporary environments.
