A free field theory typically involves fields that do not interact with each other. In the context of [[statistical mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), such a model might represent, for example, a scalar field \(\phi\) whose dynamics are governed by a quadratic [[Hamiltonian]] or [[Lagrangian]], lacking any higher-order interaction terms. The simplest form of such a Hamiltonian in a d-dimensional space for a real scalar field \(\phi\) can be written as:

$$ \mathcal{H} = \int d^dx \left[ \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \phi)^2 + \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2 \right] $$

where \((\nabla \phi)^2\) represents the spatial derivatives (kinetic term) and \(m^2\phi^2\) is a mass term, with \(m\) being the mass of the field quanta.
