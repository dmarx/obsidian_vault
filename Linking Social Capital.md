**Linking Social Capital**

Linking social capital refers to the connections and relationships between individuals and groups across different levels of power or social strata. Unlike bonding social capital (which connects people within similar groups) and bridging social capital (which connects diverse groups), linking social capital involves vertical connections that link individuals and groups to institutions, authorities, and people in positions of power. This type of social capital is essential for accessing resources, influencing policy, and achieving social and economic mobility.

### Key Characteristics of Linking Social Capital

1. **Vertical Relationships**:
   - Linking social capital is characterized by connections between individuals or groups and institutions, authorities, or people with different levels of power and social status.

2. **Access to Resources and Opportunities**:
   - These connections provide access to valuable resources, information, and opportunities that may not be available within horizontal networks of bonding or bridging social capital.

3. **Influence and Advocacy**:
   - Linking social capital enables individuals and communities to influence policies and decisions, advocate for their needs, and gain support from powerful entities.

4. **Enhanced Social Mobility**:
   - By connecting with institutions and authorities, individuals and groups can improve their social and economic mobility, enhancing their capacity to achieve long-term goals.
