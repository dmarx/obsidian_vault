The wave equation describes the propagation of waves (e.g., sound waves, electromagnetic waves) through a medium. It is a second-order hyperbolic PDE:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u $$

where $u$ is the [[wave function]], $c$ is the speed of the wave in the medium, and $\nabla^2$ is the [[Laplacian]].
