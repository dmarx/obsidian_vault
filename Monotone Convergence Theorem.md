The Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT) is a fundamental result in measure theory, specifically within the context of [[Lebesgue integration]]. It plays a crucial role in establishing the convergence properties of sequences of functions. The theorem asserts that if a sequence of measurable functions $\{f_n\}$, defined on a measure space $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$, converges monotonically to a measurable function $f$ almost everywhere, and if the functions are non-negative, then the [[integral]] of the limit function is the limit of the integrals of the functions in the sequence. This theorem is pivotal for proving the [[Dominated Convergence Theorem]] and is extensively used in various fields of mathematics, including analysis and probability theory.

### Formal Statement

Let $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ be a [[measure space]], and let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions from $X$ to $[0, \infty]$ (the extended real numbers) such that $f_n \leq f_{n+1}$ $\mu$-almost everywhere for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If $f_n \to f$ $\mu$-almost everywhere as $n \to \infty$, where $f$ is a measurable function, then
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n \, d\mu = \int_X f \, d\mu.
$$

### Key Points

- **Monotonicity**: The sequence $\{f_n\}$ must be monotonically increasing or decreasing almost everywhere. The most common statement and application of MCT involve a monotonically increasing sequence since the extension to decreasing sequences can be handled via negation.
- **Measurable Functions**: Each function $f_n$ and the limit function $f$ must be measurable with respect to the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ over the set $X$.
- **Non-negativity**: The functions $f_n$ are assumed to be non-negative, which simplifies the convergence analysis by avoiding issues with infinite negative values.
- **[[Almost Everywhere Convergence]]**: The convergence of $f_n$ to $f$ need only occur almost everywhere, meaning the set of points in $X$ where the convergence does not occur has measure zero.
- **Limit of the Integrals**: The theorem guarantees that the limit of the integrals of the $f_n$ as $n \to \infty$ equals the integral of the limit function $f$.

### Applications and Implications

- **Existence of Integrals**: MCT ensures that if the sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges appropriately, then not only does $f$ have a well-defined [[Lebesgue integral]], but this integral is also the limit of the integrals of $f_n$.
- **Justification for Interchanging Limits and Integrals**: It provides a specific scenario under which one can interchange the limit and the integral sign, a non-trivial operation in analysis.
- **Foundation for Further Theorems**: The MCT underpins other fundamental results in measure theory, such as the Dominated Convergence Theorem and Fatou's Lemma, by providing conditions under which integrals and limits interact harmoniously.
- **Practical Applications**: In probability theory, the MCT is used to justify the interchange of expectation and limit operations for sequences of random variables under certain conditions.

### Mathematical Insights

The MCT highlights a distinctive feature of the Lebesgue integral compared to the Riemann integral: its ability to handle limits of function sequences more flexibly. This is particularly valuable when dealing with complex function spaces or functions that exhibit singular behavior, where Riemann's approach might be insufficient.

By establishing a clear relationship between the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions and the limit of their integrals, the MCT furnishes a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of sequences of functions, facilitating the development of further theoretical results and practical applications in analysis and beyond.
