The [[Central Limit Theorem]] states that, under certain conditions, the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables, irrespective of the original distribution, will tend towards a normal (Gaussian) distribution as the number of variables increases. Mathematically, if $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then the sum $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \mu)$ converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
