>what is meant by the term "characteristic" here? it sounds like a technical term of art that likely has a strict formal definition of some kind

The term "characteristic" indeed has a formal definition in various contexts within mathematics and physics, often relating to properties or parameters that define or distinguish different aspects of mathematical objects, equations, or physical systems. The specific interpretation of "characteristic" can vary significantly depending on the context in which it's used. Here are a few key areas where the term has distinct, formal meanings:

### Differential Equations

In the context of partial differential equations (PDEs), a "characteristic" often refers to a curve or surface along which a PDE has a particular kind of solution behavior. For example, characteristics are used to study the propagation of waves or signals in media, where they may represent paths along which information or disturbances travel. For hyperbolic PDEs, characteristics are crucial in understanding the equation's solution structure and behavior, indicating where solutions may become discontinuous or develop singularities.

### Algebra

In algebra, particularly in ring theory, the "characteristic" of a ring is a fundamental number that describes an inherent property of the ring. Formally, it's the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n$ times the multiplicative identity equals the additive identity ($n \cdot 1 = 0$ in the ring). If no such positive integer exists, the ring is said to have characteristic zero. This concept is pivotal in understanding the structure and behavior of rings and fields, influencing properties like divisibility, the existence of certain subrings, and compatibility with numerical systems.

### Material Science and Engineering

In materials science and engineering, "characteristic" might refer to specific properties or parameters that define the behavior of materials under various conditions. For example, the characteristic strength of a material is a value below which a specified percentage of test samples are expected to fail under a particular type of stress. Characteristics in this context are essential for design and safety considerations, allowing engineers to select appropriate materials based on their performance criteria.

### Fluid Dynamics

As previously discussed in the context of turbulent flows and dissipative structures, characteristics can refer to critical parameters or properties that define the state or behavior of fluid flows. For instance, the characteristic length or velocity scale in fluid dynamics problems helps define the Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity indicating the flow regime (laminar vs. turbulent).

### Conclusion

The term "characteristic" serves as a foundational concept in multiple scientific and mathematical disciplines, providing a means to classify, analyze, and predict the behavior of systems, equations, or materials based on defining properties or parameters. Its specific meaning and implications are deeply tied to the context in which it is used, reflecting the rich and varied nature of its applications across fields.


>so generally, a "characteristic" is some kind of invariant with respect to the system for which it is "characteristic"

Yes, your understanding is essentially correct. In mathematics and physics, a "characteristic" often refers to a property or quantity that remains [[Invariants]] or serves as a defining attribute within the context of a particular system, equation, or material. It encapsulates essential features that do not change under specific operations, conditions, or transformations relevant to the system being studied. Characteristics help identify, classify, and analyze the behavior of systems by highlighting invariant or unique aspects that distinguish them from others or determine their response to various inputs or interactions.

### In Various Contexts

- **Differential Equations**: In the study of differential equations, characteristics may refer to curves or surfaces along which certain properties of the solution remain invariant, particularly in the propagation of waves or signals.

- **Algebra**: The characteristic of a ring or field, which denotes the number of times one must add the multiplicative identity (1) to itself to get the additive identity (0), is an invariant property of the algebraic structure.

- **Material Science**: Characteristics like tensile strength, elasticity, or thermal conductivity define invariant properties of materials under specified conditions.

- **Fluid Dynamics**: Characteristic scales (like length or velocity scales) or parameters (such as the Reynolds number) describe invariant or defining features of flow regimes.

### Characteristics as Invariants

The concept of invariance is central to the idea of characteristics, implying that despite variations in certain parameters or conditions, the "characteristic" property retains its defining essence, providing a stable point of reference for analysis or classification. These invariant properties are crucial for theoretical understanding, computational modeling, and practical application across various domains. They allow for the [[Simplification]] of complex systems into more manageable forms by focusing on the essential features that govern behavior or structure.
