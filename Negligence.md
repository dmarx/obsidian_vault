**Negligence**

Negligence is a legal concept that refers to a failure to exercise the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would in similar circumstances, resulting in harm or damage. It is a common basis for liability in civil law, especially in tort cases.

### Elements of Negligence

To establish a case of negligence, the plaintiff typically must prove the following four elements:

1. **[[Duty of Care]]**:
   - The defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. This means there was a legal obligation to conform to a standard of conduct to protect others from unreasonable risks.
   
2. **[[Breach of Duty]]**:
   - The defendant breached that duty by failing to act as a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances.
   
3. **[[Causation]]**:
   - The defendant’s breach of duty caused the plaintiff’s harm. Causation has two sub-elements:
     - **Actual Cause (Cause-in-Fact)**: The harm would not have occurred "but for" the defendant’s actions.
     - **Proximate Cause (Legal Cause)**: The harm was a foreseeable result of the defendant’s actions.
     
4. **Damages**:
   - The plaintiff suffered actual harm or damage as a result of the defendant’s breach of duty.

### Types of Negligence

1. **[[Comparative Negligence]]**:
   - The plaintiff’s own negligence is compared to the defendant’s negligence. Damages awarded to the plaintiff are reduced by the percentage of their own fault.
   - **Pure Comparative Negligence**: The plaintiff can recover damages even if they are 99% at fault, though their recovery is reduced by their degree of fault.
   - **Modified Comparative Negligence**: The plaintiff can recover only if their fault is less than 50% (or 51%, depending on the jurisdiction).

2. **[[Contributory Negligence]]**:
   - If the plaintiff is found to have contributed to their own harm, they may be barred from recovering any damages. This is a harsher rule and less common in modern jurisdictions.

3. **[[Gross Negligence]]**:
   - A more severe form of negligence involving a reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others. It goes beyond simple carelessness or failure to exercise reasonable care.

### Legal Context and Applications

Negligence is a foundational concept in tort law and is applicable in various scenarios:

- **Medical Malpractice**: A healthcare professional’s failure to meet the standard of care, resulting in patient harm.
- **Product Liability**: Manufacturers can be held liable if they fail to ensure their products are safe for consumers.
- **Personal Injury**: Accidents such as car crashes where one party’s failure to exercise reasonable care causes injury to another.

### Mathematical Formalization

Negligence can be conceptualized using probabilistic models. Consider the following:

- Let $P(H)$ be the probability of harm occurring.
- Let $B$ be the burden or cost of taking precautions.
- Let $L$ be the potential loss or damage from the harm.

Using the Hand Formula (from Judge Learned Hand in U.S. v. Carroll Towing Co.):

$$
B < P(H) \times L
$$

Negligence occurs if the burden of taking precautions is less than the product of the probability of harm and the potential loss. If $B$ is less than $P(H) \times L$, the defendant should have taken the precautions, and failing to do so constitutes negligence.

### Case Law Examples

#### Example 1: Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)

This foundational case established the modern concept of duty of care. Mrs. Donoghue consumed ginger beer containing a decomposed snail, leading to illness. The court held that manufacturers owe a duty of care to consumers to ensure their products are safe.

#### Example 2: Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co. (1928)

This case addressed proximate cause. Mrs. Palsgraf was injured by falling scales caused by an explosion when railway employees helped a man board a train with a package of fireworks. The court ruled that the harm was not a foreseeable result of the employees’ actions, thus no negligence.

### Related Concepts

- **[[Duty of Care]]**: The legal obligation to avoid causing harm.
- **[[Breach of Duty]]**: The failure to meet the standard of care.
- **[[Causation]]**: The link between the breach of duty and the harm caused.
- **[[Damages]]**: The compensation sought by the plaintiff for the harm suffered.

Understanding negligence involves comprehending how the law balances individual responsibility and societal expectations to protect against unreasonable risks. It is essential for ensuring accountability and justice in civil law.
