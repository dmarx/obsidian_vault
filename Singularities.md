Singularities -- in the context of [[Information Geometry]] -- refer to points where the usual smoothness assumptions about the space break down. These can be points where the model is not well-defined, or where there is a sudden change in the model's structure (e.g., a [[Phase Transitions|phase transition]]).

### Singularities in Information Theory

Singularities, in the context of [[Information Theory]] and deep learning, can refer to points in [[Loss Landscape|parameter space]] where the model's behavior [[Phase Transitions|changes abruptly]] or where the information processing capacity of the model experiences a sudden transition. These points can be critical in understanding the [[Learning Dynamics]] of neural networks, as they may represent thresholds beyond which the network significantly alters its representation or processing of information.
