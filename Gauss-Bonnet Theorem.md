The Gauss-Bonnet theorem provides a powerful link between the geometry of a surface and its topology, specifically relating Gaussian curvature and the [[Euler Characteristic]]. The theorem states that for a compact two-dimensional [[Manifolds]] (surface) without boundary, the integral of the [[Gaussian Curvature]] (\(K\)) over the entire surface (\(S\)) is directly related to the Euler characteristic of the surface:

$$ \int_S K \, dA = 2\pi \chi $$

This equation means that the total [[Curvature]] of a surface, when integrated over the whole surface, yields a value that depends only on the topological characteristics of the surface—the Euler characteristic—not on the specific geometric details of how the surface is curved or shaped.
