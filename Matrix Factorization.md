Matrix factorization techniques are fundamental in machine learning, especially for tasks involving representation learning, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction. These techniques decompose a matrix into simpler, meaningful components, uncovering latent structures within the data. Here are several key matrix factorizations relevant to machine learning and their applications in representation learning:

### [[Singular Value Decomposition]] (SVD)

- **Overview:** SVD decomposes a matrix $A$ into three matrices $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V^T$, where $A = U\Sigma V^T$. Here, $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices representing the left and right singular vectors of $A$, and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of $A$.
- **Applications:** SVD is instrumental in principal component analysis (PCA), latent semantic analysis (LSA) for natural language processing, and in building recommender systems through collaborative filtering. It's effective for dimensionality reduction, noise reduction, and data compression.

### [[Eigenvalue Decomposition]] (EVD)

- **Overview:** EVD decomposes a square matrix $A$ into $PDP^{-1}$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues, and $P$ is a matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors. EVD is applicable only to square matrices that are diagonalizable.
- **Applications:** EVD is crucial for PCA when applied to covariance matrices for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. It also underpins many algorithms in spectral clustering and graph analysis.

### [[Non-negative Matrix Factorization]] (NMF)

- **Overview:** NMF decomposes a non-negative matrix $A$ into two non-negative matrices $W$ and $H$, such that $A \approx WH$. NMF is particularly useful for interpreting the components of the decomposition due to the non-negativity constraint.
- **Applications:** NMF finds applications in parts-based, sparse representation learning where the goal is to learn the parts of objects (e.g., in image analysis, text mining, and bioinformatics). It's also used in recommender systems and for topic modeling in text documents.

### [[QR Decomposition]]

- **Overview:** QR decomposition factorizes a matrix $A$ into an orthogonal matrix $Q$ and an upper triangular matrix $R$. This factorization is $A = QR$.
- **Applications:** QR decomposition is used in solving linear least squares problems, which are ubiquitous in machine learning. It provides a stable method for solving over-determined systems of equations, critical in regression analysis.

### [[LU Decomposition]]

- **Overview:** LU decomposition factorizes a matrix into a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$. Sometimes, a permutation matrix $P$ is also used to improve numerical stability, resulting in $PA = LU$.
- **Applications:** While not directly used in representation learning, LU decomposition is fundamental in numerical linear algebra for solving systems of linear equations, inverses, and determinant computations, which are steps in various machine learning algorithms.

### [[Cholesky Decomposition]]

- **As discussed earlier,** Cholesky decomposition is specifically used for positive definite matrices, offering a numerically stable and efficient way to solve systems of equations and perform optimizations in algorithms that require positive definiteness.

### Applications in [[Representation Learning]]

In representation learning, these matrix factorizations play crucial roles in discovering latent features, reducing dimensionality, and building models that capture the intrinsic structure of the data. For example:

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA (via SVD or EVD) reduce the dimensionality of the data, helping in uncovering the latent structure and facilitating visualization, compression, and noise reduction.
- **Feature Extraction:** Algorithms like NMF extract parts-based features that offer interpretable components, useful in image processing, text analysis, and understanding complex data.
- **Optimization and Solving Equations:** Factorizations such as QR and Cholesky are essential in the optimization steps of various machine learning algorithms, ensuring numerical stability and efficiency.

By leveraging these matrix factorizations, machine learning practitioners can design models that are not only computationally efficient but also capable of capturing and representing the underlying complexities of large and high-dimensional datasets.
