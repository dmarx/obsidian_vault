auto-book/auto-wiki: show local graph, and *propose pages in the local graph*. Add links to proposed nodes to pull them into the 1 step neighborhood. This triggers process to propose the new additions to the two step neighborhood: the 1 step neighborhood around the (previously proposed) newly added node
