In the context of our discussion, a "complex system" refers to a system composed of interconnected parts that as a whole exhibit one or more properties (behavior or structure) not obvious from the properties of the individual parts. These systems are often characterized by specific features that help distinguish them from merely "complicated" systems. The definition of complex systems is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing from physics, biology, computer science, sociology, and more. Here are key characteristics that typically define a complex system:

### 1. [[Emergence]]
Emergence is the occurrence of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems. The whole becomes not only more than but very different from the sum of its parts. For example, the collective behavior of social insects like ants emerges from simple rules followed by individuals without a central control structure.

### 2. [[Nonlinearity]]
Nonlinear interactions mean that small changes can lead to disproportionately large effects (positive feedback) or that increasing input might lead to diminishing effects (negative feedback). This nonlinearity makes the behavior of complex systems particularly sensitive to initial conditions, leading to unpredictability or chaotic behavior even in deterministic systems.

### 3. [[Feedback Loops]]
Feedback loops are fundamental to the behavior of complex systems, allowing the system to self-regulate and adapt to changes. Positive feedback loops can amplify system responses, leading to exponential growth or runaway effects, while negative feedback loops tend to dampen responses, promoting stability.

### 4. [[Adaptation]] and [[Evolution]]
Complex systems often have the capacity to adapt or evolve in response to the environment. This adaptability is crucial for the survival and efficiency of biological organisms, ecosystems, and even social and economic systems, enabling them to respond to internal and external changes.

### 5. [[Self-Organization]]
Self-organization refers to the ability of a system to spontaneously develop a structured organization without being guided or managed by an outside source. This process is driven by internal rules and interactions among the system's components, leading to patterns, structures, or behaviors that emerge at the macroscopic level.

### 6. Interconnected and Interdependent Components
The components of a complex system are not only numerous but also exhibit varying degrees of connectivity and interdependence. The structure of these connections—whether in networks, hierarchies, or other configurations—significantly influences the system's dynamics and its response to perturbations.

### 7. Open Systems
Many complex systems are open, exchanging energy, matter, or information with their environment. This openness is a key factor in the system's dynamics and its far-from-equilibrium behavior, allowing for the continuous flow necessary for maintaining structure and function.

### 8. Edge of Chaos
Complex systems often operate at the "edge of chaos," a critical zone between order and disorder where the system is said to be most adaptive and capable of complex behavior. This balance allows for both the stability needed to maintain organization and the flexibility to adapt and evolve.

While this overview provides a framework for understanding what constitutes a complex system, it's important to note that the specifics can vary greatly across different domains. The unifying theme, however, is the focus on how systemic properties emerge from the interactions of parts within a whole, leading to behaviors and outcomes that are not predictable from the components alone. This concept has profound implications across science, engineering, and humanities, offering insights into everything from the workings of the human brain to the dynamics of global economies.

In the context of our discussion, a "complex system" refers to a system composed of many interacting components or parts, where the interactions lead to emergent behavior that cannot be simply inferred from the properties of the individual components. This concept transcends specific disciplines, applying to systems in physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, social sciences, and computer science, among others. While the precise definition might slightly vary across fields, certain key characteristics are commonly associated with complex systems:

### Key Characteristics of Complex Systems

- **Emergence:** The system displays properties and behaviors that emerge from the interactions of its components, which are not present at the level of individual elements. This emergent behavior is often unpredictable based on knowledge of the system's parts alone.

- **Nonlinearity:** The interactions within the system often exhibit nonlinearity, meaning small changes in input or initial conditions can lead to disproportionately large changes in output or future state.

- **Adaptation and Evolution:** Complex systems are capable of adaptation; they can change their behavior or structure in response to their environment. Over longer timescales, these systems can evolve, developing new structures or modes of behavior.

- **Self-Organization:** These systems have the capacity to self-organize, forming patterns, structures, or behaviors from local interactions among their components without being directed by an external command.

- **Feedback Loops:** Complex systems often involve feedback loops, where the system's output can serve as input back into the system, amplifying (positive feedback) or dampening (negative feedback) certain behaviors.

- **Network of Interactions:** The components of complex systems are often connected in networks that determine how information, energy, or materials flow through the system. The structure of these networks significantly impacts the system's behavior.

### Examples Across Disciplines

- **Biological Systems:** An ecosystem or a single organism, where myriad interactions among species or cells lead to the overall behavior and functionality of the system.

- **Social Systems:** Human societies or social networks, where individual and collective behaviors emerge from the interactions of many individuals.

- **Technological Systems:** The internet or power grids, where the overall function emerges from the interconnected network of devices, users, or power sources.

- **Physical and Chemical Systems:** Climate systems or chemical reactions in non-equilibrium states, where complex patterns and behaviors emerge from the interactions of physical and chemical components.

### Concrete Definition in Context

In the context of this conversation, when referring to "complex systems," we are discussing systems that exhibit these characteristics, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of the principles that govern their dynamics. This perspective highlights that regardless of the system's specific material, scale, or domain, the underlying principles of interaction, emergence, and adaptation play critical roles in shaping the system's behavior and evolution. The study of complex systems, therefore, seeks to understand how these principles operate across different contexts, aiming to uncover universal patterns, mechanisms, and strategies for navigating complexity.
