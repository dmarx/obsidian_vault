Corporations impose a serious x-risk to humanity. Examples include leaded gasoline, the bhopal disaster, global warming, fascism, naziism, genocide. The behaviors of long-persisting collectives -- whose original motivating foundation by its constituent individuals was to be beneficial towards its constituency -- often become divorced from the needs of its constituency and *literally take on a life of its own as a "movement" of some kind*. When this happens, the Corporate component can often be regulated by other Corporations in its shared environment, resulting in e.g. wars and other forms of inter-Corporate competition.
