Transport phenomena refer to the study of how momentum, energy, and mass move within and between different mediums. These processes are crucial for understanding a wide range of non-equilibrium dynamics, where systems are not in a static or uniform state but instead show gradients (in temperature, concentration, or velocity) that drive the flow of these quantities. Non-equilibrium dynamics involve systems transitioning between states or maintaining states that are not in equilibrium due to external forces or internal reactions.

### Core Aspects of Transport Phenomena

Transport phenomena are traditionally divided into three main categories, each corresponding to a fundamental aspect of physical systems:

1. **Momentum Transport (Fluid Dynamics)**: Involves the study of how forces and velocity fields within fluids lead to motion and flow. This is governed by the [[Navier-Stokes Equations]], which describe how the velocity field of a fluid evolves over time under the influence of internal viscosity and external forces.

2. **Energy Transport (Heat Transfer)**: Concerns the movement of energy in various forms (conductive, convective, and radiative) through and between different materials. The fundamental principles are captured by the heat equation, which describes how temperature gradients lead to heat flow, aiming to reach thermal equilibrium.

3. **Mass Transport (Diffusion)**: Describes how substances move from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, driven by concentration gradients. [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] provide a quantitative description of this process, which is fundamental to understanding chemical reactions, biological processes, and material properties.

### Non-equilibrium Dynamics

In the context of [[non-equilibrium dynamics]], transport phenomena play a central role in driving the system towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] or maintaining it in a steady-state away from [[equilibrium]]. Key concepts include:

- **Steady-State vs. Transient Processes**: In [[steady-state processes]], the system's properties (temperature, velocity, concentration) do not change over time, even though there may be continuous transport of mass, momentum, and energy. In contrast, [[transient processes]] involve time-dependent changes as the system evolves towards equilibrium or another steady state.

- **Thermodynamic Forces and Fluxes**: Non-equilibrium dynamics are characterized by thermodynamic forces (such as temperature gradients, pressure gradients, or chemical potential gradients) that give rise to fluxes (heat flow, fluid flow, or mass flow). The relationship between these forces and fluxes is described by constitutive equations, such as [[Fourier's law of heat conduction]] and Fick's laws for diffusion.

- **Irreversibility and Entropy Production**: Transport processes in non-equilibrium dynamics are inherently irreversible, contributing to the production of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that these processes lead to an increase in the overall entropy of the universe.

### Applications

Transport phenomena are fundamental to engineering disciplines (chemical, mechanical, civil, and biomedical engineering), as well as to physics, chemistry, and biology. They are crucial for the design of reactors, environmental systems, biomedical devices, and material processing techniques. Understanding transport phenomena allows for the control and optimization of systems for desired outcomes, such as efficient energy conversion, effective drug delivery, and the mitigation of environmental pollutants.

### Conclusion

Transport phenomena provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing and understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of physical systems. By studying how momentum, energy, and mass are transported under various conditions, scientists and engineers can predict and manipulate the behavior of a wide range of systems, from microscopic cellular processes to large-scale environmental and industrial operations.
