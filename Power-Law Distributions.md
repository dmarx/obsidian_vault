Power-law distributions are a type of statistical distribution characterized by the frequency of an event decaying polynomially with the size of the event. This means that smaller events occur very frequently, whereas larger events are rare but have significant impacts. Power-law distributions are found in a wide range of phenomena, from earthquake magnitudes to city sizes and wealth distributions among individuals.
