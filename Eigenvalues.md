Eigenvalues are a fundamental concept in linear algebra with extensive applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other disciplines. They play a crucial role in understanding linear transformations and matrices, providing insights into the properties of systems described by these transformations.

### Definition

Given a square matrix $A$, an eigenvalue $\lambda$ is a scalar for which there exists a non-zero vector $\mathbf{v}$ (called an eigenvector) such that:

$$A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}$$

This equation expresses a fundamental property: when the matrix $A$ acts on the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$, the result is a new vector that is a scalar multiple (specifically, $\lambda$ times) of the original vector $\mathbf{v}$. The eigenvalue $\lambda$ represents the factor by which the eigenvector is stretched or compressed during this transformation.

### Finding Eigenvalues

The eigenvalues of a matrix $A$ can be found by solving the characteristic equation:

$$\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$$

where $\det$ denotes the determinant, and $I$ is the identity matrix of the same dimension as $A$. Solving this equation for $\lambda$ yields the eigenvalues of $A$.

### Applications

- **[[Differential Equations]]**: In the study of differential equations, eigenvalues are used to solve linear differential equations with constant coefficients. This application is crucial in physics for systems that can be modeled linearly, such as oscillating systems, quantum mechanics, and electrical circuits.

- **[[Stability Analysis]]**: In systems theory and control engineering, the stability of a system can often be determined by examining the eigenvalues of its system matrix. A system is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts.

- **[[Vibration Analysis]]**: The natural frequencies of a vibrating system, such as a bridge or a building, correspond to the square roots of the eigenvalues of a matrix representing the system's physical properties.

- **[[Quantum Mechanics]]**: Eigenvalues are integral to quantum mechanics, where they represent observable quantities (such as energy levels) associated with operators acting on quantum states. The Schr√∂dinger equation, for instance, involves finding eigenvalues (energy levels) of the Hamiltonian operator.

- **[[Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA)**: In statistics and machine learning, PCA uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors to perform dimensionality reduction, identifying the directions (principal components) that maximize the variance in data.

- **[[PageRank]] Algorithm**: The PageRank algorithm, which was used by Google to rank web pages in search results, is based on the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of a matrix representing the web's link structure.

### Significance

The concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors provides a powerful tool for simplifying and analyzing linear transformations and systems. By reducing complex systems to their fundamental modes (represented by eigenvectors) and associated scales of action (represented by eigenvalues), we can gain deeper insights into the behavior and properties of a wide range of physical, biological, and artificial systems.
