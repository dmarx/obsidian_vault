### [[Social Identity Theory]]
Henri Tajfel's social identity theory provides a valuable framework for analyzing how individuals perceive and value their memberships in various social groups. According to this theory, people's self-concepts are partly determined by their perceived membership in social groups, such as nationality, ethnicity, or social class. The theory posits three psychological processes that are particularly relevant in the context of fascism:

1. **Social Categorization**: Individuals categorize themselves and others into groups, which helps simplify the social environment. This categorization is the foundation for defining in-groups and out-groups.

2. **Social Identification**: Individuals identify with certain groups, and this identity becomes part of their self-concept. In fascist contexts, the regime intensifies this process by promoting a monolithic national or racial identity, which is often mythologized and glorified.

3. **Social Comparison**: Once individuals identify with a group, they compare their group against others. This is driven by a desire to maintain a positive social identity. In the pursuit of a positive distinction, members may exaggerate the positive attributes of their in-group and the negative attributes of out-groups.
