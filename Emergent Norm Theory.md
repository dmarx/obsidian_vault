[[Emergent Norm Theory]] is a concept within the field of social psychology that offers an explanation for how individual behavior and norms develop in crowd and collective situations. This theory contrasts with earlier models of crowd behavior, such as those proposed by Gustave Le Bon, which suggested that crowds exert a hypnotic influence on their members, leading to irrational and emotional behavior. Instead, Emergent Norm Theory posits that people in a crowd begin with diverse individual attitudes and behaviors but come to adopt a common norm or set of norms through a process of social interaction and negotiation.

### Key Principles of Emergent Norm Theory

- **[[Social Norms]]:** At the heart of Emergent Norm Theory is the idea that norms guide behavior in social contexts. Norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by members of a society or group. In crowd situations, these norms may not be initially clear or established.

- **[[Emergence of Norms]]:** In the context of a crowd or collective event, especially during situations that are ambiguous, novel, or lacking clear social norms, new norms emerge through a process of social interaction among participants. People look to each other's behavior to understand how to act, particularly observing the actions of those who seem to take on leadership roles or those who act more decisively.

- **[[Role Differentiation]]:** As norms begin to emerge, individuals within the crowd may adopt specific roles. Some become leaders or influencers, often by being the first to act in a certain way, while others follow these emergent norms.

- **[[Negotiation]]:** The establishment of norms is a dynamic and negotiated process. As individuals interact, they express approval or disapproval of certain behaviors, thereby shaping the evolving norms.

### Mathematical and Computational Perspectives

While Emergent Norm Theory is primarily qualitative, its concepts can be explored and analyzed through computational models, particularly within the framework of agent-based modeling (ABM). In ABMs, agents (representing individuals in a crowd) follow simple rules, but complex behaviors emerge from their interactions. These models can simulate how:

1. **Initial Conditions:** Various initial states of individual beliefs and behaviors can influence the emergence of norms. By varying these conditions, one can study how quickly and what type of norms emerge.

2. **[[Interaction Rules]]:** Agents interact based on predefined rules that mimic real-world social cues and negotiations. These rules can include mechanisms for influence, conformity, and dissent, allowing the model to explore how these factors contribute to the emergence of norms.

3. **[[Role Adoption]]:** Agents can be programmed with the potential to adopt different roles based on their interactions and the evolving dynamics of the group. This can illustrate how certain individuals become leaders or influencers in the crowd.

4. **[[Feedback Loops]]:** The model can incorporate feedback loops where the emerging norms influence individual behaviors, which in turn affect the norms, showcasing the dynamic interplay between individual actions and group norms.

$$\text{Agent State at Time } t+1: \, s_{i}(t+1) = F(s_{i}(t), \{s_{j}(t)\}_{j \in N_i}, R)$$

Here, $s_{i}(t)$ represents the state of agent $i$ at time $t$, $\{s_{j}(t)\}_{j \in N_i}$ represents the states of agents within the neighborhood $N_i$ of agent $i$, and $R$ represents the rules of interaction and norm emergence. $F$ is a function that updates the agent's state based on its current state, the states of neighboring agents, and the rules of interaction.

### Applications and Implications

Understanding how norms emerge and influence behavior in crowds has practical implications for managing public events, designing public spaces, and understanding social movements. By applying insights from Emergent Norm Theory, organizers and policymakers can better predict crowd behavior, prevent panic or violence, and foster positive social environments in situations ranging from protests to celebrations.

In summary, Emergent Norm Theory provides a nuanced understanding of crowd behavior, emphasizing the dynamic and negotiated nature of social norms and their emergence from individual interactions within crowds.
