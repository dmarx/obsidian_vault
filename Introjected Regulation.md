### Introjected Regulation

**Introjected Regulation** is a type of extrinsic motivation described in [[Organismic Integration Theory]] (OIT), a sub-theory of [[Self-Determination Theory]] (SDT) developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. Introjected regulation occurs when individuals internalize external demands or pressures, but do so in a way that is not fully assimilated into their self-concept. This results in behavior driven by internal pressures, such as guilt, anxiety, or the desire to gain approval or avoid disapproval.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Introjected regulation refers to the internalization of external controls where behavior is motivated by internal pressures, such as guilt, obligation, or self-esteem contingencies, rather than by genuine interest or personal endorsement.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Partial Internalization**: The regulation is internalized but not fully integrated into the self.
   - **Internal Pressures**: Behavior is driven by feelings of obligation, self-imposed pressure, or the desire to avoid negative emotions.
   - **Contingent Self-Esteem**: Actions are often taken to maintain self-worth or self-image, making self-esteem contingent on meeting certain standards or receiving approval from others.

3. **Examples**:
   - A student studies hard because they would feel guilty if they didn’t meet their parents’ expectations.
   - An employee works late hours to avoid feeling like a failure in front of colleagues.
   - An athlete trains intensely to avoid feelings of shame or to receive praise from a coach.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Autonomy and Control**:
   - Introjected regulation lacks true autonomy because the motivation comes from internalized external pressures rather than from one's own values or interests.

2. **Emotional Drivers**:
   - **Guilt and Shame**: Individuals engage in behaviors to avoid negative emotions associated with failing to meet internalized standards.
   - **Pride and Ego Enhancement**: Behaviors are also driven by the pursuit of positive self-regard or to gain approval and admiration from others.

#### Theoretical Framework

1. **Motivational Continuum**:
   - In the SDT framework, introjected regulation is more self-determined than external regulation but less so than identified or integrated regulation:
     - **External Regulation**: Behavior is driven by external rewards or punishments.
     - **Introjected Regulation**: Behavior is driven by internal pressures.
     - **Identified Regulation**: Behavior is aligned with personal goals and values.
     - **Integrated Regulation**: Behavior is fully assimilated with the self.

2. **Autonomy Spectrum**:
   - Introjected regulation is positioned in the middle of the autonomy spectrum, indicating that while some internalization has occurred, it is not fully autonomous.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Ryan and Connell (1989)**:
   - **Study**: Investigated children's reasons for engaging in school activities.
   - **Findings**: Identified different types of extrinsic motivation, including introjected regulation, which was associated with behaviors driven by guilt and self-approval.

2. **Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, and Ryan (1991)**:
   - **Review**: Summarized research showing that introjected regulation is associated with less stable and less enduring motivation compared to more self-determined forms of regulation (identified and integrated).

3. **Sheldon and Elliot (1998)**:
   - **Study**: Examined personal goals and their underlying motivations.
   - **Results**: Found that goals motivated by introjected regulation were associated with lower well-being and less satisfaction compared to goals motivated by more autonomous forms of regulation.

#### Implications

1. **Education**:
   - **Teaching Practices**: Educators should aim to move students from introjected regulation to more autonomous forms of motivation by fostering environments that support autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

2. **Workplace**:
   - **Management Practices**: Employers should recognize that while introjected regulation can drive performance, it is often accompanied by stress and burnout. Strategies should be implemented to help employees internalize organizational goals more autonomously.

3. **Healthcare**:
   - **Patient Motivation**: Health interventions should focus on supporting patients in developing more self-determined motivations for health behaviors, moving beyond compliance driven by guilt or pressure.
