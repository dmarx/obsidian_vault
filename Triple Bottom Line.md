**Triple Bottom Line (TBL)**

The Triple Bottom Line (TBL) is a framework for measuring organizational performance across three dimensions: social, environmental, and economic. Coined by John Elkington in 1994, TBL encourages businesses to go beyond traditional financial metrics to also consider their impact on people and the planet. This holistic approach aims to create sustainable value for all stakeholders, ensuring long-term business success while contributing positively to society and the environment.

### Key Components of the Triple Bottom Line

     - **Fair Labor Practices**: Ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and non-discrimination.
     - **Community Engagement**: Contributing to the well-being of local communities through philanthropy, volunteerism, and support for social causes.
     - **Human Rights**: Upholding and promoting human rights within the organization and throughout the supply chain.
     - **Diversity and Inclusion**: Fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace where all individuals are respected and valued.
