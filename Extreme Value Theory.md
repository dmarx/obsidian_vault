### Extreme Value Theory

**Extreme Value Theory (EVT)** focuses on the asymptotic distribution of the maximum or minimum of a sample as the sample size becomes very large. It's a key part of understanding risks in various domains such as finance, insurance, environmental science, and engineering, where understanding the behavior of tail-end events (extreme risks) is crucial. EVT is divided into two main types:
- **Type I (Gumbel)**: For block maxima or minima of unbounded distributions.
- **Type II (Fr√©chet)**: For maxima of distributions with a power-law tail.
- **Type III (Weibull)**: For minima of distributions bounded from above.
