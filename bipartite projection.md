A bipartite projection is a method used in network science to transform a bipartite graph (also known as a two-mode network) into a one-mode (unipartite) network. In a bipartite graph, nodes are divided into two distinct sets, and edges can only connect nodes from different sets. This type of network is common in scenarios where there are two types of entities, and connections only exist between unlike entities, such as authors and publications, actors and movies, or customers and products.

The projection of a bipartite graph onto one of its sets creates a new network consisting only of nodes from that set, with edges between them based on their shared connections to nodes in the other set in the original bipartite graph. This process results in a unipartite network that highlights the relationships between entities of the same type based on their common relationships with entities of the other type.

### Steps in Bipartite Projection

1. **Select the Node Set for Projection:** Choose one of the two sets of nodes in the bipartite graph as the basis for the projection. This set will form the nodes of the resulting unipartite network.

2. **Establish Connections Based on Shared Partners:** In the resulting unipartite network, create an edge between two nodes if they have at least one shared neighbor (i.e., a common connection) in the other set of the original bipartite graph.

3. **Weight the Edges (Optional):** In some applications, it may be useful to weight the edges in the projected network based on the number of shared neighbors or some other metric that reflects the strength or intensity of the relationship.

### Example

Consider a simple bipartite network of actors and movies. The two sets of nodes are actors and the movies in which they have appeared. In the projected network based on the set of actors, there would be an edge between any two actors who have appeared in at least one movie together. The weight of an edge could represent the number of movies shared between the two actors, indicating the strength of their professional collaboration.

### Applications

Bipartite projections are widely used in various fields to uncover hidden patterns and relationships:

- **Social Network Analysis:** Revealing connections between individuals based on shared affiliations, events, or collaborations.
  
- **Collaboration Networks:** Identifying collaborations among scientists or authors by projecting their co-authorship of papers or projects.
  
- **Recommendation Systems:** Generating product recommendation networks by projecting the connections between customers and products they have purchased.

### Considerations and Challenges

- **Loss of Information:** The projection process may result in the loss of some information about the original bipartite relationships, as it only retains information about shared connections.

- **Edge Density:** Projected networks can become very dense, especially if many nodes in the original bipartite graph share connections. This can make analysis and visualization challenging.

- **Interpretation:** The meaning of edges in the projected network is different from that in the original bipartite network. In the projected network, edges represent indirect connections through the bipartite network's other set.

Bipartite projection is a powerful tool for simplifying and analyzing complex networks by focusing on the relationships within a single set of nodes. However, the method's utility and the interpretation of results depend heavily on the context of the bipartite network and the objectives of the analysis.

>matrix factorization and bipartite community detection

Matrix factorization and bipartite community detection are interconnected techniques used in the analysis of complex networks, particularly for uncovering latent structures and communities within bipartite (or two-mode) networks. Bipartite networks, where nodes are divided into two distinct sets with edges only between sets and not within them, are common in various domains, including recommendation systems, ecological networks, and social networks. Matrix factorization methods provide a powerful approach to identify and characterize communities within such networks by decomposing the adjacency matrix of the network into lower-dimensional matrices that reveal patterns of association between nodes.

### Matrix Factorization

[[Matrix factorization]] refers to the process of decomposing a matrix into a product of two or more matrices. In the context of bipartite networks, the adjacency matrix \(A\) of the network is decomposed into matrices that represent latent factors associated with the nodes of the two sets. For a bipartite network with two sets of nodes \(U\) and \(V\), the adjacency matrix \(A\) can be factorized as follows:

$$
A \approx WH^T
$$

where:
- \(A\) is the \(m \times n\) adjacency matrix of the bipartite network, with \(m\) and \(n\) being the number of nodes in sets \(U\) and \(V\), respectively.
- \(W\) is an \(m \times k\) matrix representing the affiliation of nodes in set \(U\) to \(k\) latent communities or factors.
- \(H\) is an \(n \times k\) matrix representing the affiliation of nodes in set \(V\) to the same \(k\) latent communities or factors.
- \(^T\) denotes the transpose of a matrix.

The factor \(k\) is a parameter that specifies the number of latent communities to detect and typically is chosen based on domain knowledge or through model selection techniques. The entries in matrices \(W\) and \(H\) indicate the strength of association between nodes and latent communities, facilitating the identification of community structures.

### Applications of Matrix Factorization for [[Community Detection]]

1. **Recommender Systems:** In systems recommending products to users, matrix factorization can identify underlying patterns in user-item interactions, grouping users and items into latent factors that represent implicit interests or categories.

2. **[[Social Network Analysis]]:** Decomposing the adjacency matrix of social networks where individuals are connected to events, organizations, or groups can reveal communities based on shared affiliations.

3. **Ecology and Biology:** Analyzing networks of species and their environments or genes and traits can uncover groups of species or genes that share common environmental factors or traits.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Choice of \(k\):** Selecting the appropriate number of latent communities (\(k\)) is crucial for meaningful decomposition and can significantly impact the results. Techniques like cross-validation or criteria such as the silhouette score can help in choosing \(k\).

- **Interpretation of Latent Factors:** The latent factors identified by matrix factorization are not always straightforward to interpret and require domain-specific knowledge to make sense of the communities or patterns uncovered.

- **Sparsity:** Bipartite networks, especially in domains like recommendation systems, often have sparse adjacency matrices, which can pose challenges for factorization techniques. Regularization and other techniques may be employed to address this issue.

- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The computational complexity of matrix factorization can be high, particularly for large networks, necessitating efficient algorithms and sometimes approximations to make the computation feasible.

Matrix factorization serves as a robust method for detecting latent structures and communities in bipartite networks, offering insights into the complex relationships and patterns that govern these systems. Its application across various fields underscores its versatility and power in extracting meaningful information from complex networks.

A bipartite projection is a process used to simplify the structure of bipartite graphs, which are a specific type of graph where nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets such that edges only connect nodes from different sets. The bipartite projection onto one of these sets creates a new graph consisting only of nodes from that set, with edges between nodes that were connected through nodes in the other set in the original bipartite graph.

### Original Bipartite Graph

Consider a bipartite graph \(G=(U,V,E)\), where:
- \(U\) and \(V\) are the two disjoint sets of nodes.
- \(E\) is the set of edges, and each edge connects a node in \(U\) to a node in \(V\).

This structure is common in scenarios like authorship networks (where \(U\) could be authors, \(V\) could be papers, and edges represent authorship), or in customer-product networks (where \(U\) could be customers, \(V\) could be products, and edges indicate purchases).

### Bipartite Projection

The projection of \(G\) onto the set \(U\) is a new graph \(G_U=(U,E_U)\) where:
- \(U\) is the same set of nodes from the original graph.
- \(E_U\) is the set of edges formed between nodes in \(U\) based on their shared connections to nodes in \(V\) in the original graph. Specifically, an edge is placed between \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) in \(G_U\) if and only if there exists at least one node \(v\) in \(V\) such that both \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) are connected to \(v\) in the original graph \(G\).

### Characteristics and Applications

- **Information Loss:** The projection process can lead to information loss regarding the original bipartite structure since the distinction between the two sets of nodes and the specifics of their connections through \(V\) are not retained in the projection.

- **Increased Density:** Bipartite projections often result in denser graphs, especially if many nodes in \(U\) share connections to common nodes in \(V\). This can sometimes lead to challenges in analysis due to the increased complexity of the resulting network.

- **Community Detection:** Projections are particularly useful for revealing hidden patterns or communities within one set of nodes, based on their shared relationships with the other set.

- **Simplification for Analysis:** While some information is lost, the simplification can make certain types of analysis more feasible, particularly when the focus is on understanding the relationships and interactions within one set of nodes.

### Example

In a simple authorship network:
- Let \(U = \{\text{Alice, Bob, Charlie}\}\) be authors.
- Let \(V = \{\text{Paper 1, Paper 2}\}\) be papers.
- Edges represent authorship, e.g., Alice and Bob wrote Paper 1, while Bob and Charlie wrote Paper 2.

The projection onto \(U\) yields a graph where:
- Nodes are authors: \(\{\text{Alice, Bob, Charlie}\}\).
- Edges are formed between all pairs of authors who co-authored at least one paper, resulting in a fully connected graph among Alice, Bob, and Charlie, indicating their collaboration network.

Bipartite projections thus provide a powerful tool for analyzing the inherent structures and relationships within one category of nodes, based on their interactions with another category, across various fields like social network analysis, biology, and more.

> bipartite projection and membership networks

Bipartite projection is a key method in the analysis of [[Membership Networks]], which are a specific type of network structure often encountered in social network analysis, ecology, and various other domains. Membership networks inherently have a bipartite or two-mode nature, where there are two distinct sets of entities: members and groups. Members can belong to any number of groups, but there are no direct links between members or between groups; connections exist only between members and groups to which they belong.

### Original Bipartite Graph in Membership Networks

In the context of membership networks, the bipartite graph \(G = (U, V, E)\) represents:
- \(U\), a set of nodes representing members (e.g., authors, actors, customers).
- \(V\), a set of nodes representing groups (e.g., papers, movies, products).
- \(E\), a set of edges, where each edge connects a member in \(U\) to a group in \(V\) that the member belongs to or has interacted with.

### Bipartite Projection onto Membership or Group Networks

The projection process transforms the bipartite graph into a unipartite (or one-mode) network, focusing on either the member or group perspective:
- **Member Projection:** Projects the bipartite graph onto the set \(U\), resulting in a new graph \(G_U=(U,E_U)\) where edges in \(E_U\) connect pairs of members who share membership in at least one common group in \(V\). This projection highlights the direct and indirect relationships between members based on shared group affiliations.
- **Group Projection:** Projects the bipartite graph onto the set \(V\), leading to a graph \(G_V=(V,E_V)\) where edges in \(E_V\) link pairs of groups that have at least one member in common. This projection emphasizes how groups are related through overlapping memberships.

### Analysis and Applications

- **Community Detection:** Projections can reveal communities or clusters within the network, indicating groups of members who are closely connected through common memberships or groups that are related through shared members.
- **Collaboration Networks:** In scientific collaboration networks, member projections can identify clusters of researchers who frequently co-author papers, providing insights into collaboration patterns and research communities.
- **Recommendation Systems:** In customer-product networks, group projections can help identify similar products based on shared customer bases, which can be used to recommend products to customers with similar buying patterns.
- **Social Network Analysis:** Member projections in social networks can uncover hidden social structures, such as groups of friends with common interests or affiliations, facilitating the study of social cohesion and influence.

### Challenges

- **Loss of Information:** The projection process may result in the loss of detailed information about individual memberships in groups, as the direct connections between members and groups are replaced by indirect connections within the member or group sets.
- **Increased Edge Density:** Projections, especially member projections, can lead to networks with high edge densities if many members share common group memberships. This can complicate the analysis and visualization of the resulting network.

Bipartite projection is a powerful tool in network analysis, enabling researchers to simplify and focus on the relationships within one category of nodes (members or groups) in membership networks. By revealing the underlying patterns and structures in these relationships, bipartite projection facilitates a deeper understanding of the dynamics and characteristics of complex systems.
