Duality, particularly Poincaré duality, is a principle that reveals a deep symmetry within the structure of topological spaces, specifically within the context of homology and cohomology.

- **[[Poincare Duality]]**: In a closed orientable manifold of dimension \(n\), Poincaré duality states that the \(k\)-th homology group, \(H_k\), is isomorphic to the \((n-k)\)-th cohomology group, \(H^{n-k}\). This duality connects the study of cycles (homology) with the study of closed forms (cohomology), showing that information about the space can be encoded equivalently in two seemingly different mathematical languages.
- **Implications**: Poincaré duality implies that every homology class has a dual cohomology class, and vice versa. This duality is used extensively in the calculation of topological invariants and in the formulation of theories in mathematical physics.
