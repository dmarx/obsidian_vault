Self-similarity is a characteristic of objects or patterns that show invariance or similarity across different scales. This means a self-similar object appears similar to a part of itself when viewed at different magnitudes of zoom. This property is a hallmark of [[fractals]], which are complex structures known for their repeating patterns at every scale, but the concept also finds relevance in various scientific and mathematical contexts, from [[geometry]] to natural phenomena and even in financial markets.

### In Mathematics and Geometry

In mathematics, self-similarity is often explored in the context of fractal geometry. Fractals are mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating structure at every scale and are described by non-integer (fractional) dimensions. Classic examples include:

- **The [[Mandelbrot Set]]**: A set of complex numbers for which the function $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ does not diverge when iterated from $z=0$, showing intricate, never-ending detail at every level of magnification.
- **The [[Sierpinski Triangle|Sierpiński Triangle]]**: A triangle recursively subdivided into smaller equilateral triangles, demonstrating self-similarity as the pattern repeats at progressively smaller scales.
- **The [[Koch Snowflake]]**: Generated by starting with an equilateral triangle and recursively altering each line segment, creating a shape with an infinitely long perimeter and self-similar structure.

### In Nature

Many natural phenomena exhibit self-similar properties, often as a result of simple rules of growth or patterns of formation. Examples include:

- **[[Coastlines]]**: Displaying fractal-like properties where measuring the length of a coastline can yield different results depending on the scale of measurement, a phenomenon known as the coastline paradox.
- **Trees and Plants**: The branching patterns of trees and plants often show self-similarity, with branches, sub-branches, and leaves exhibiting similar patterns.
- **[[River Networks]]**: The [[branching patterns]] of rivers and their tributaries often exhibit self-similar properties across different scales.

### In Physical Sciences

Self-similarity appears in various physical and dynamic systems, reflecting underlying principles of [[scale invariance]]:

- **[[Turbulence]]**: Fluid turbulence exhibits self-similar patterns in the [[vortices]] and [[eddies]] formed at different scales within a [[turbulent flow]].
- **Crystals and Snowflakes**: The molecular structure of crystals and the intricate patterns of snowflakes demonstrate self-similarity in their geometric arrangements.

### In Finance

In financial markets, self-similarity is observed in the patterns of market prices and indexes. The concept of fractal markets hypothesis suggests that market prices exhibit self-similarity and scale invariance over time, making patterns observed in short-term charts resemble those in long-term charts.

### In Art and Architecture

Self-similarity also finds expression in art and architecture, both as a principle of design and as a source of aesthetic fascination. M.C. Escher's artwork, Islamic geometric patterns, and Gothic cathedrals’ structures often incorporate self-similar designs, demonstrating complexity and harmony.

The concept of self-similarity transcends disciplinary boundaries, providing insight into the underlying structures and dynamics of [[Complex Systems Theory|complex systems]]. It highlights the universal patterns that can emerge from simple rules and underscores the interconnectedness of the natural and mathematical worlds.
