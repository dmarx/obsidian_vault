A **[[Simplex]]** is the convex hull of a finite set of points in a Euclidean space that do not all lie in the same hyperplane. Formally, an $n$-dimensional simplex (or $n$-simplex) can be defined as the convex hull of $n + 1$ affinely independent points. These points are called the vertices of the simplex.
