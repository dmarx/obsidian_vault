small communities are ofoten associated with energy barriers

usually this manifests as some kind of common interest, e.g. /r/artisanvideos

or an occupation, like the "brotherhood" of firefighters

i often find ways to turn work into a chore.

---

if i go off and do my own thing, my plan is basically to... what, just do something interesting and hope someone throws money at me to keep doing it? it happened once, but that was a unique circumstance. 

there's definitely consulting. i could definitely consult. people basically beg me to consult already. 

$500/hr, 12hrs month, 4 weeklies with three clients ~ 1mtg/2day = "AI office hours" consulting

combine with a weekly public office hours stream/twitter live
- could probably attract loads of clients just doing that

so... this is going to require turning myself into a brand. isn't it. 

i should just lean into it already
