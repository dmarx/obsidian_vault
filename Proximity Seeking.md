It is a fundamental component of attachment theory, playing a crucial role in forming and maintaining secure attachments.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Attachment Theory**:
   - Developed by John Bowlby, attachment theory posits that proximity seeking is an innate behavior that ensures the survival of infants by keeping them close to their caregivers.

2. **Neurochemical Processes**:
   - **Oxytocin**: Often called the "bonding hormone," oxytocin is released during physical closeness and social bonding, promoting feelings of trust and attachment.
   - **Endorphins**: Natural painkillers and mood enhancers released during positive social interactions, reinforcing proximity-seeking behavior.

   - **Self-Soothing**: Physical closeness to an attachment figure helps individuals self-soothe and regulate emotions.
   - **Exploratory Behavior**: Secure attachment provides a safe base from which individuals can explore their environment and return to for comfort.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Ainsworth (1978)**:
   - **Study**: Developed the Strange Situation procedure to observe attachment behaviors in infants.
   - **Findings**: Identified that securely attached infants seek proximity to their caregivers when distressed, demonstrating the role of proximity seeking in attachment security.

2. **Hazan and Shaver (1987)**:
   - **Research**: Applied attachment theory to adult romantic relationships.
   - **Results**: Found that adults exhibit proximity-seeking behaviors similar to those observed in infants, seeking closeness to their partners for comfort and support.

3. **Feldman (2012)**:
   - **Study**: Investigated the role of oxytocin in human bonding.
   - **Findings**: Showed that oxytocin promotes proximity seeking and attachment behaviors in both children and adults.
