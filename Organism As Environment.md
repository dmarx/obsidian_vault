Eukaryote = Archae + Porkaryote : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y75hzZjSjSA&list=WL&index=21

An organism is a complex system of interacting subcomponents. The environment in which these subcomponents interact defines the boundaries of the organism. The organism is therefore not defined by the subcomponents but rather by the environment broadly. Therefore, a "harm" or "injury" towards the organism can be characterized as modifications to the environment that make pre-existing interactions less efficient, more costly, or less likely.

the question then is how to differentiate "harm" from "regulation"?
