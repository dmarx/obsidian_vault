> tell me about attractors, singularities (information theory), their potential connection to phase change learning dynamics as observed with "grocking" phenomena, boundary effects, and connections to chaos theory

### Attractors in Dynamical Systems

An attractor is a set of numerical values toward which a system tends to evolve, for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system. In the context of neural networks and deep learning, attractors can represent stable states or patterns that the network learns to recognize or generate. For instance, in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used for sequence processing, attractors can correspond to stable sequences or patterns that the network converges to over time.
