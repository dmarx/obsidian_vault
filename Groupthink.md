Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, where the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Coined by social psychologist Irving Janis in 1972, the term is now widely used to describe how a group of people may prioritize consensus over the critical evaluation of alternatives, leading to poor decision-making processes.

### Key Characteristics of Groupthink
Janis identified several symptoms that indicate the presence of groupthink in groups:

1. **Illusion of Invulnerability**: Members of the group share an unwarranted optimism that leads to excessive risk-taking.

2. **Collective Rationalization**: Group members discount warnings and do not reconsider their assumptions, ignoring the moral and ethical consequences of their decisions.

3. **Belief in Inherent Morality**: Members believe in the rightness of their cause and therefore ignore the ethical or moral consequences of their decisions.

4. **Stereotyped Views of Out-Groups**: The group constructs negative stereotypes of rivals outside the group, viewing them as too evil to negotiate with or too weak to defend themselves against.

5. **Direct Pressure on Dissenters**: Members pressure any in the group who express arguments against the group's stereotypes, illusions, or commitments, viewing such opposition as disloyalty.

6. **Self-Censorship**: Doubts and deviations from the perceived group consensus are not expressed.

7. **Illusion of Unanimity**: The majority view and judgments are assumed to be unanimous.

8. **Self-Appointed ‘Mindguards’**: Members protect the group and the leader from information that is problematic or contradictory to the group’s cohesiveness, views, and/or decisions.

### Causes of Groupthink
Groupthink typically occurs in groups where there is a clear hierarchy or a directive leadership style that promotes a particular solution. Other factors contributing to groupthink include:

- **High Cohesion**: When group members have strong bonds, they may prioritize maintaining these bonds over making the best decision.
- **Isolation**: Groups that are isolated from outside opinions are more likely to develop a closed mindset.
- **Lack of Methodical Procedures**: Absence of formal rules and norms for decision making and information gathering contributes to poor analysis and judgment.

### Prevention Strategies
To avoid groupthink, groups should adopt practices that encourage open dialogue and critical evaluation:

- **Encourage Dissent**: Leaders should actively encourage diverse opinions and critique. 
- **Appoint Devil's Advocates**: Assigning one or more group members to challenge the group's ideas can prevent premature consensus.
- **Seek External Opinions**: Groups should consult outside experts or stakeholders to get external viewpoints that challenge internal assumptions.
- **Set up Independent Groups**: Breaking a large group into smaller, independent teams can help to generate a variety of solutions and reduce the pressure to conform.
- **Anonymous Feedback**: Using secret ballots or anonymous suggestion boxes can help elicit honest opinions and criticisms.

### Applications and Implications
Groupthink is not only a problem in corporate or governmental settings but can also occur in any decision-making group, including juries, boards, and non-profit organizations. Understanding groupthink and its prevention is crucial for leaders who aim to foster effective, innovative, and ethical decision-making within groups. The consequences of groupthink can be severe, leading to disastrous decisions that are not only ineffective but also unethical, highlighting the importance of vigilance against such dynamics in any collaborative environment.

## Groupthink

**Groupthink** is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, where the desire for harmony and conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Members of the group strive for consensus without critically testing, analyzing, and evaluating ideas. The term was coined by social psychologist Irving Janis in 1972.

### Core Characteristics of Groupthink

1. **Illusion of Invulnerability**: Members of the group may develop an illusion of invulnerability, leading them to take excessive risks.
2. **Collective Rationalization**: The group collectively rationalizes decisions, discounting warnings and negative feedback.
3. **Belief in Inherent Morality**: Members believe in the inherent morality of their group, leading them to overlook ethical or moral consequences of their decisions.
4. **Stereotyping of Outsiders**: Those who oppose the group’s ideas are stereotyped as weak, evil, or unintelligent.
5. **Self-Censorship**: Individuals suppress their doubts and counter-arguments.
6. **Illusion of Unanimity**: The majority view and judgments are assumed to be unanimous.
7. **Direct Pressure on Dissenters**: Members apply pressure on anyone in the group who expresses arguments against the group’s decisions.
8. **Mindguards**: Some members appoint themselves to protect the group from adverse information that might threaten group complacency.

### Causes of Groupthink

1. **High Group Cohesiveness**: The closer the group members, the higher the likelihood of groupthink.
2. **Structural Faults**: Homogeneity of members’ social backgrounds and ideology, lack of impartial leadership, and insulation of the group from outside opinions contribute to groupthink.
3. **Situational Context**: High-stress situations, recent failures, or moral dilemmas can precipitate groupthink.

### Consequences of Groupthink

1. **Poor Decision-Making**: The group may make irrational and suboptimal decisions due to the lack of critical evaluation.
2. **Suppression of Dissent**: Valuable alternative viewpoints and critical thinking are suppressed.
3. **Lack of Creativity**: The group’s creativity is stifled as members conform to the prevailing view.
4. **Misperception of Reality**: The group develops a skewed perception of reality, often underestimating risks and overestimating rewards.

### Famous Examples of Groupthink

1. **Bay of Pigs Invasion (1961)**: The US government's decision to invade Cuba was largely influenced by groupthink within President Kennedy's advisory team, leading to a failed military operation.
2. **Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster (1986)**: NASA's decision to launch the Challenger despite warnings about potential malfunctions in the O-rings was influenced by groupthink, resulting in a tragic accident.
3. **Enron Scandal (2001)**: Groupthink among Enron executives contributed to unethical decision-making and the eventual collapse of the company.

### Preventing Groupthink

1. **Encourage Open Debate**: Leaders should encourage open discussion and welcome dissenting viewpoints.
2. **Appoint a Devil’s Advocate**: Designating one or more individuals to challenge assumptions and decisions can help prevent groupthink.
3. **Bring in Outside Experts**: Consulting external experts can provide fresh perspectives and reduce insularity.
4. **Create Independent Groups**: Dividing the group into subgroups can foster independent thinking and diverse viewpoints.
5. **Seek Anonymous Feedback**: Allowing anonymous input can help surface honest opinions and critical feedback.

### Empirical Evidence

#### Janis (1972)

In his seminal book “Victims of Groupthink,” Janis analyzed historical policy decisions to illustrate how groupthink led to poor outcomes. His case studies, including the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Korean War, highlighted the detrimental effects of groupthink on decision-making.

#### Turner and Pratkanis (1998)

Turner and Pratkanis explored the psychological mechanisms underlying groupthink, emphasizing the role of social identity and group cohesion in fostering conformist thinking. They suggested strategies for mitigating groupthink, such as promoting critical evaluation and diverse group composition.

Understanding and addressing groupthink is crucial for organizations, governments, and any decision-making bodies to ensure rational, creative, and ethical outcomes. By fostering an environment that values diversity of thought and encourages critical evaluation, the negative impacts of groupthink can be mitigated.
