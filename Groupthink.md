Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, where the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Coined by social psychologist Irving Janis in 1972, the term is now widely used to describe how a group of people may prioritize consensus over the critical evaluation of alternatives, leading to poor decision-making processes.

### Key Characteristics of Groupthink
Janis identified several symptoms that indicate the presence of groupthink in groups:

1. **Illusion of Invulnerability**: Members of the group share an unwarranted optimism that leads to excessive risk-taking.

2. **Collective Rationalization**: Group members discount warnings and do not reconsider their assumptions, ignoring the moral and ethical consequences of their decisions.

3. **Belief in Inherent Morality**: Members believe in the rightness of their cause and therefore ignore the ethical or moral consequences of their decisions.

4. **Stereotyped Views of Out-Groups**: The group constructs negative stereotypes of rivals outside the group, viewing them as too evil to negotiate with or too weak to defend themselves against.

5. **Direct Pressure on Dissenters**: Members pressure any in the group who express arguments against the group's stereotypes, illusions, or commitments, viewing such opposition as disloyalty.

6. **Self-Censorship**: Doubts and deviations from the perceived group consensus are not expressed.

7. **Illusion of Unanimity**: The majority view and judgments are assumed to be unanimous.

8. **Self-Appointed ‘Mindguards’**: Members protect the group and the leader from information that is problematic or contradictory to the group’s cohesiveness, views, and/or decisions.

### Causes of Groupthink
Groupthink typically occurs in groups where there is a clear hierarchy or a directive leadership style that promotes a particular solution. Other factors contributing to groupthink include:

- **High Cohesion**: When group members have strong bonds, they may prioritize maintaining these bonds over making the best decision.
- **Isolation**: Groups that are isolated from outside opinions are more likely to develop a closed mindset.
- **Lack of Methodical Procedures**: Absence of formal rules and norms for decision making and information gathering contributes to poor analysis and judgment.

### Prevention Strategies
To avoid groupthink, groups should adopt practices that encourage open dialogue and critical evaluation:

- **Encourage Dissent**: Leaders should actively encourage diverse opinions and critique. 
- **Appoint Devil's Advocates**: Assigning one or more group members to challenge the group's ideas can prevent premature consensus.
- **Seek External Opinions**: Groups should consult outside experts or stakeholders to get external viewpoints that challenge internal assumptions.
- **Set up Independent Groups**: Breaking a large group into smaller, independent teams can help to generate a variety of solutions and reduce the pressure to conform.
- **Anonymous Feedback**: Using secret ballots or anonymous suggestion boxes can help elicit honest opinions and criticisms.

### Applications and Implications
Groupthink is not only a problem in corporate or governmental settings but can also occur in any decision-making group, including juries, boards, and non-profit organizations. Understanding groupthink and its prevention is crucial for leaders who aim to foster effective, innovative, and ethical decision-making within groups. The consequences of groupthink can be severe, leading to disastrous decisions that are not only ineffective but also unethical, highlighting the importance of vigilance against such dynamics in any collaborative environment.
