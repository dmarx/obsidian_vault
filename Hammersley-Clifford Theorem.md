The Hammersley-Clifford Theorem states that a probability distribution of a random field defined over a graph is a Markov random field if and only if it can be represented as a product of potential functions, each depending only on subsets of variables that form cliques in the graph. This theorem is conditional on the distribution being strictly positive (the positivity condition), which ensures that no configuration of the variables is forbidden or has zero probability.
