[[Karl Friston]]'s Free Energy Principle provides a mathematical and theoretical framework for understanding how biological systems maintain their order and adapt to their environment. By minimizing free energy, a system reduces the difference between its predicted state and the actual state, thereby resisting [[Entropy|disorder]]. This principle, applied to the brain, suggests a mechanism for how simple neuronal interactions can give rise to complex [[Adaptation|adaptive]] behaviors and cognitive processes. Friston's work bridges the gap between physical principles and biological phenomena, offering insights into the [[Emergence|emergent]] nature of life and [[Consciousness]].
