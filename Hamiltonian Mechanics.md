Hamiltonian mechanics reformulates the principles of [[Lagrangian Mechanics]] in terms of [[Energy]] rather than action. The central quantity is the Hamiltonian, $H$, which is often interpreted as the total energy of the system (kinetic plus potential energy). It is obtained through a [[Legendre Transformation]] of the [[Lagrangian]], changing the variables from generalized coordinates and velocities ($q_i, \dot{q}_i$) to generalized coordinates and momenta ($q_i, p_i$), where $p_i = \partial L / \partial \dot{q}_i$ are the conjugate momenta.

The equations of motion in Hamiltonian mechanics, known as Hamilton's equations, are:

$$
\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}
$$
