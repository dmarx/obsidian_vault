Differential [[topology]] is a branch of mathematics that uses the techniques of differential and [[integral]] calculus, along with [[Linear Algebra|linear]] and [[multilinear algebra]], to study the topological and geometric properties of differentiable manifolds. A differentiable manifold is a [[topological manifold]] equipped with a globally defined differential structure. Differential topology focuses on those properties of manifolds that are invariant under [[diffeomorphisms]], essentially treating [[manifolds]] that can be smoothly transformed into each other as being equivalent.

### Key Concepts

- **[[Differentiable Manifolds]]**: At the heart of differential topology are differentiable manifolds, which generalize curves and surfaces to higher dimensions. A differentiable manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space and on which one can perform calculus.

- **Diffeomorphisms**: These are smooth bijective maps between manifolds with smooth inverses. Diffeomorphisms are of central interest because they preserve the differentiable structure of manifolds, allowing differential topology to study properties invariant under such transformations.

- **[[Tangent Space|Tangent Spaces]] and Vectors**: For any point on a manifold, the tangent space is a vector space consisting of the tangent vectors to all possible curves through the point. This concept is crucial for defining derivatives of functions between manifolds and for formulating physical laws in a geometric language.

- **[[Vector Bundles]]**: These are a generalization of the tangent bundle, which associates a vector space with each point of a manifold. They provide a framework for discussing fields (like vector fields or tensor fields) defined on manifolds.

- **[[Morse Theory]]**: This is a method for analyzing the topology of manifolds by studying smooth functions on them. Morse theory relates the topology of the manifold to the [[critical points]] of these functions, providing a powerful tool for understanding manifold structure.

### Importance and Applications

Differential topology plays a crucial role in both mathematics and physics:

- **Mathematical Applications**: It provides the foundational language for much of modern [[geometry]], including [[Riemannian geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]], and [[complex manifold theory]]. It's also instrumental in proving fundamental theorems about manifold classification and structure.

- **Physics**: Differential topology is used extensively in the formulation of theories of spacetime and gravity ([[general relativity]]), in the [[phase space]] formulation of classical mechanics, and in the modern approaches to quantum field theory and string theory. The ability to describe physical phenomena in geometric terms has led to profound insights into the nature of the universe.

### Techniques and Theorems

Several key techniques and theorems in differential topology include:

- **[[Transversality]]**: This concept deals with how [[submanifolds]] intersect in a manifold. The [[transversality theorem]] provides conditions under which intersections happen in "nice" ways, and it's a key tool for understanding the [[intersection theory]].

- **[[Whitney Embedding Theorem]]**: This theorem states that any smooth $n$-dimensional manifold can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, showing that the world of abstract manifolds is not so far removed from the familiar Euclidean space.

- **[[Sard's Theorem]]**: It gives conditions under which the set of critical values (the image of the points where the derivative of a map fails to be surjective) of a smooth map has [[measure]] zero. This result is fundamental in Morse theory and in the study of smooth maps between manifolds.

- **[[Morse Theory]]**: As mentioned, Morse theory connects the topology of a manifold to the critical points of smooth functions defined on it. This provides a way to study the manifold's topology by examining functions rather than the manifold directly.

Differential topology serves as the underpinning of many areas of mathematical research and has deep connections with [[algebraic topology]], allowing for the study of spaces that might not possess a smooth structure. Its emphasis on the invariance under diffeomorphisms helps mathematicians focus on the "essential geometry" of spaces, abstracting away from the specifics of how they are presented or embedded in higher-dimensional spaces.
