**Learned Helplessness** is a psychological phenomenon wherein individuals come to believe that they have no control over the outcomes of their actions, leading to a state of passive resignation. This concept was extensively studied by Martin Seligman and his colleagues, initially in the context of animal behavior, and later applied to human psychology.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Learned helplessness occurs when individuals repeatedly encounter uncontrollable and adverse situations, leading them to believe that their efforts are futile. This belief can generalize to other situations, resulting in passivity, decreased motivation, and a sense of helplessness.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Passivity**: Individuals exhibit passive behavior, even when opportunities to change their circumstances are present.
   - **Lack of Initiative**: Reduced willingness to try new or challenging tasks.
   - **Decreased Motivation**: Lowered motivation to pursue goals or respond to challenges.
   - **Cognitive Deficits**: Difficulty in learning that responses can be effective when previously learned that responses were ineffective.
   - **Emotional Distress**: Increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.

3. **Behavioral Indicators**:
   - **Avoidance of Challenges**: Tendency to avoid situations that require effort or persistence.
   - **Low Persistence**: Giving up easily when faced with difficulties.
   - **Negative Expectancies**: Expectation of failure or poor outcomes regardless of effort.

#### Mechanisms

1. **[[Perception of Control]]**:
   - Learned helplessness is fundamentally linked to an individual's perception of control. When people repeatedly experience situations where their actions have no effect on outcomes, they begin to perceive that they lack control over their environment.

2. **[[Attribution Theory]]**:
   - According to attribution theory, individuals with learned helplessness tend to attribute failures to internal, stable, and global factors (e.g., "Iâ€™m not good at anything"), while successes are attributed to external, unstable, and specific factors (e.g., "I was just lucky").

3. **Generalization**:
   - The sense of helplessness learned in one context can generalize to other contexts, leading to a pervasive sense of inefficacy and passivity across various aspects of life.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Seligman and Maier (1967)**:
   - **Experiment**: Dogs were subjected to inescapable electric shocks. Later, when given an opportunity to escape, the dogs that had experienced inescapable shocks did not attempt to escape, even though they could avoid the shock by simply moving to the other side of the cage.
   - **Findings**: Demonstrated that exposure to uncontrollable aversive events led to learned helplessness, evidenced by passivity and lack of escape attempts.

2. **Hiroto and Seligman (1975)**:
   - **Study**: Examined learned helplessness in humans. Participants exposed to uncontrollable noise later failed to escape noise in situations where escape was possible, similar to the dogs in the initial experiments.
   - **Results**: Showed that learned helplessness can occur in humans and affects their motivation and behavior.

3. **Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale (1978)**:
   - **Research**: Developed the learned helplessness reformulation, linking it to depression. They proposed that learned helplessness results from individuals' attributional style, specifically how they explain negative events.
   - **Findings**: Connected learned helplessness with depressive symptoms, showing that individuals who attribute failures to internal, stable, and global causes are more prone to depression.

#### Implications

1. **Mental Health**:
   - **Depression**: Learned helplessness is closely related to depression. Interventions focusing on altering attributional styles and enhancing perceived control can be effective in treating depressive symptoms.
   - **Therapeutic Approaches**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help individuals reframe their thoughts and beliefs about control, improving their sense of efficacy and reducing feelings of helplessness.

2. **Education**:
   - **Student Motivation**: Teachers should provide supportive and responsive environments that emphasize effort and strategies over inherent ability, helping students develop a growth mindset.
   - **Intervention Programs**: Programs designed to enhance students' sense of control and efficacy can reduce learned helplessness and improve academic outcomes.

3. **Workplace**:
   - **Employee Development**: Employers should create environments that promote autonomy, competence, and relatedness to reduce feelings of helplessness and enhance motivation and performance.
   - **Management Practices**: Providing opportunities for employees to have control over their work and offering positive feedback can mitigate learned helplessness.

Understanding learned helplessness is crucial for developing strategies to prevent and address its negative impact on motivation and well-being. By fostering environments that support autonomy, competence, and control, educators, employers, and mental health professionals can help individuals overcome learned helplessness and achieve more positive outcomes.
