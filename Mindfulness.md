### Mindfulness

**Mindfulness** is the practice of being fully present and engaged in the current moment, aware of your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. It involves cultivating a state of focused attention and acceptance, which can enhance psychological well-being and resilience.

#### Key Aspects

   - **[[Nonjudgmental Observation]]**: Observing thoughts and feelings without labeling them as good or bad.
   - **[[Acceptance]]**: Accepting experiences as they are without trying to change or avoid them.
   - **[[Intentional Attention]]**: Deliberately directing attention to the present moment.

3. **Benefits**:
