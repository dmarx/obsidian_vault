### Geometry of Manifolds
Geometry deals with the properties of space that are related to distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. In the context of [[Manifolds]], which can be thought of as spaces that locally resemble [[Euclidean Space]], geometry concerns itself with how these manifolds are [[Curvature|curved]], how [[distances]] are measured, and how angles are defined. [[Differential Forms]] and their integrals are tools that allow us to [[measure]] geometric quantities like volumes, fluxes, and circulations within these curved spaces.
