### Integrated Regulation

**Integrated Regulation** is a type of extrinsic motivation described in [[Organismic Integration Theory]] (OIT), a sub-theory of [[Self-Determination Theory]] (SDT) developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. Integrated regulation represents the most autonomous form of extrinsic motivation, where external regulations are fully assimilated into one's self-concept and are congruent with one's values and identity.

#### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**:
   Integrated regulation occurs when individuals fully internalize and integrate external motivations, aligning them with their core values, beliefs, and identity. The behavior is performed willingly and is seen as part of who they are, even if the activity itself is not inherently enjoyable.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Full Internalization**: External regulations are completely integrated into the self.
   - **Congruence with Self**: The behavior is consistent with personal values, goals, and identity.
   - **High Autonomy**: Actions are taken out of true volition and self-endorsement.

3. **Examples**:
   - A person exercises regularly not only because they value health and fitness but because it aligns with their identity as a healthy person.
   - An employee engages in corporate social responsibility initiatives because they genuinely care about social and environmental issues, and these align with their personal values.
   - A student chooses to study a particular subject because it resonates with their career aspirations and personal interests, integrating their academic efforts with their long-term goals.

#### Mechanisms

1. **Autonomy and Self-Determination**:
   - Integrated regulation enhances autonomy as individuals engage in behaviors that are fully aligned with their self-concept and values.

2. **Internalization Process**:
   - The process involves deep internalization where external motivations are not only identified as important but are harmonized with other aspects of the self.

#### Theoretical Framework

1. **Motivational Continuum**:
   - In the SDT framework, integrated regulation is positioned just below intrinsic motivation in terms of self-determination:
     - **External Regulation**: Behavior is driven by external rewards or punishments.
     - **Introjected Regulation**: Behavior is driven by internal pressures.
     - **Identified Regulation**: Behavior is aligned with personal goals and values.
     - **Integrated Regulation**: Behavior is fully assimilated with the self.
     - **Intrinsic Motivation**: Behavior is engaged in for its inherent enjoyment and satisfaction.

2. **Autonomy Spectrum**:
   - Integrated regulation is highly autonomous, as it involves behaviors that are both valued and endorsed by the individual’s sense of self.

#### Experimental Evidence

1. **Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, and Ryan (1991)**:
   - **Review**: Summarized various studies showing that integrated regulation leads to more stable and enduring motivation compared to other forms of extrinsic motivation.

2. **Gagné and Deci (2005)**:
   - **Meta-Analysis**: Reviewed research on workplace motivation, finding that employees with integrated regulation showed greater job satisfaction, well-being, and performance.

3. **Ryan and Deci (2000)**:
   - **Study**: Explored different types of motivation and their impact on behavior and well-being, highlighting that integrated regulation is associated with high levels of psychological well-being.

#### Mathematical Formalization

To formalize integrated regulation, consider a model that captures the full internalization and alignment with personal values:

1. **Motivational Continuum**:
   - Let $M$ represent the level of motivation, ranging from $M_{am}$ (amotivation) to $M_{in}$ (intrinsic motivation), with intermediate levels representing various forms of extrinsic motivation ($M_{ex}$).

2. **Internalization Process**:
   - The probability of fully integrating an external regulation $E$ into integrated regulation $I$ can be modeled as:
   $$
   P(I \mid E) = f(A, C, R)
   $$
   where $A$, $C$, and $R$ represent the satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, respectively, and $f$ is a function reflecting the internalization process.

3. **Degree of Self-Determination**:
   - The degree of self-determination $D$ associated with a behavior can be expressed as a weighted sum of its regulatory components:
   $$
   D = w_{ex}M_{ex} + w_{in}M_{in} + w_{id}M_{id} + w_{int}M_{int}
   $$
   where $w_{ex}$, $w_{in}$, $w_{id}$, and $w_{int}$ are weights representing the extent to which behavior is extrinsically regulated, identified, integrated, or intrinsically motivated, respectively.

#### Implications

1. **Education**:
   - **Teaching Practices**: Educators should create learning environments that help students integrate academic goals with their personal values and interests, fostering deeper engagement and commitment.

2. **Workplace**:
   - **Management Practices**: Employers should communicate the broader purpose and values of tasks and projects, helping employees see how their work aligns with their personal and professional identity.

3. **Healthcare**:
   - **Patient Motivation**: Healthcare providers should support patients in integrating health behaviors with their personal values and lifestyle, promoting long-term adherence and well-being.
