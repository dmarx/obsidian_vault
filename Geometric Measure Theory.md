Geometric [[Measure Theory]] (GMT) is a mathematical discipline that bridges the gap between geometric analysis and measure theory. It focuses on studying geometric properties and structures, such as surfaces and curves, within the rigorous framework provided by measure theory. GMT deals with problems where both the geometry of the objects and their measure (such as length, area, or volume) are of fundamental importance. This field has applications and connections to various areas of mathematics, including [[Calculus of Variations]], [[Partial Differential Equations]] (PDEs), [[Differential Geometry]], and [[Topology]].

### Key Concepts and Tools

- **[[Rectifiable Sets]]:** These are sets that can be approximated by a [[Countable]] union of [[Lipschitz Mappings]] from subsets of Euclidean spaces. The notion of [[rectifiability]] extends the concept of smooth manifolds to more general sets that might have [[Singularities]] but still possess a well-defined notion of [[Tangent Space|tangents]] and [[Dimensionality|dimension]] [[Almost Everywhere Convergence|almost everywhere]].

- **[[Currents]]:** Inspired by the concept of [[Differential Forms]], currents extend the classical notion of oriented surfaces to more general geometric objects. Currents allow for the definition of [[Boundary]] and can be used to formulate and solve generalizations of the [[Plateau Problem]], concerning the existence and regularity of surfaces that span a given contour with minimal area.

- **[[Varifolds]]:** Varifolds generalize the notion of a [[variational surface]], providing a framework for analyzing the variational properties of families of surfaces, particularly focusing on questions of minimality and stationarity with respect to a [[geometric functional]], like surface area.

- **[[Hausdorff Measure]] and [[Dimension]]:** The Hausdorff measure generalizes the concept of [[Lebesgue Measure]] to sets of arbitrary dimension, including [[fractals]]. It plays a crucial role in GMT, especially in defining and studying fractal dimensions and the measure-theoretic properties of complex geometric sets.

- **[[Sobolev Spaces]] in GMT:** The theory often employs Sobolev spaces, which consist of functions equipped with norms that measure both the size of a function and its derivatives. These spaces are crucial for studying variational problems and PDEs within the geometric measure theory context.

### Applications and Results

- **[[Minimal Surfaces]]:** GMT provides tools for studying minimal surfaces, surfaces that locally minimize area. The theory has been used to solve existence and regularity problems for minimal surfaces, including those with free boundaries or singularities.

- **[[Calculus of Variations]]:** Many problems in the calculus of variations, such as finding the shape that minimizes a certain energy or cost functional, can be addressed using GMT. This includes famous problems like the Plateau problem.

- **[[Geometric Inequalities]]:** GMT has been used to prove and generalize various geometric inequalities, including [[isoperimetric inequalities]], which relate the volume of a set to the surface area of its boundary.

- **PDEs and [[Geometric Flows]]:** GMT interacts with the study of PDEs through problems like the evolution of surfaces under mean curvature flow, where measure-theoretic techniques are used to handle singularities and discontinuities in the flow.

GMT stands at the intersection of analysis, geometry, and topology, offering deep insights into the structure and behavior of geometric objects in a measure-theoretic setting. It has led to significant advancements in understanding the geometry and topology of sets and spaces, especially in contexts where traditional smooth methods do not apply.
