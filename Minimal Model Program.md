The Minimal Model Program (MMP), also known as Mori's program after one of its key contributors, [[Shigefumi Mori]], is a monumental framework in algebraic geometry aimed at classifying [[higher-dimensional algebraic varieties]]. It seeks to describe every algebraic variety in terms of simpler, more fundamental pieces, called "[[minimal models]]," or to show that the variety can be [[fibred]] over a lower-dimensional variety, revealing a deep structure within the [[category of algebraic varieties]]. The program extends the concepts of [[surface classification]] to higher dimensions, aiming to understand the structure of varieties through birational transformations and reduction to simpler forms.

### Key Concepts

- **[[Algebraic Varieties]]**: These are geometric objects defined as the zeros of polynomials over algebraically closed fields. Varieties serve as the fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry.

- **[[Birational Equivalence]]**: Two varieties are birationally equivalent if they are isomorphic outside of lower-dimensional subsets. Birational geometry focuses on the properties of varieties that are preserved under such equivalences.

- **[[Minimal Models]]**: A minimal model of a variety is a variety that is birationally equivalent to the original but is simpler in some sense (for example, having a minimal number of singularities). For many classes of varieties, minimal models are expected to exist and to be unique up to isomorphism.

- **[[Kodaira Dimension]]**: An invariant of algebraic varieties under birational equivalence, the Kodaira dimension measures the growth rate of sections of powers of the canonical bundle. It plays a critical role in classifying varieties according to the complexity of their canonical divisors.

- **[[Mori Fiber Spaces]]**: When a variety cannot be simplified to a minimal model in its dimension (usually due to negative curvature properties), the MMP seeks to express it as a fibration over a lower-dimensional base, with the fibers being simpler varieties. These fiber spaces are integral to understanding the global structure of algebraic varieties.

### Goals and Achievements

- **Classification**: The ultimate goal of the MMP is to classify all algebraic varieties up to birational equivalence by reducing the study of arbitrary varieties to the study of minimal models and Mori fiber spaces.

- **Canonical Models**: For varieties of general type (those with maximal Kodaira dimension), the program aims to construct canonical models that are unique representatives of their birational equivalence classes.

- **Singularities and Flips**: The MMP involves understanding and controlling the singularities that arise during the process of simplification, including the use of flips and contractions to systematically reduce complexity.

### Challenges and Progress

The Minimal Model Program is highly ambitious and remains an active area of research, particularly in dimensions three and higher. While significant progress has been made, including the proof of the existence and termination of flips, many aspects of the program are still being developed, and its full realization is one of the central goals of contemporary algebraic geometry.

### Impact

The MMP has profound implications beyond algebraic geometry, influencing number theory, symplectic geometry, and mathematical physics. By providing a structured approach to the classification of algebraic varieties, it enhances our understanding of the geometric and topological properties of spaces defined algebraically, contributing to a unified picture of the landscape of mathematical structures.
