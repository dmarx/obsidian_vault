>To the best of your unassisted knowledge, what are some major developments in the academic philosophy of mind research space since 2007

Since 2007, the field of philosophy of mind has seen several important developments, reflecting both advancements in related sciences like neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence, and shifts in philosophical approaches. Here are some of the key areas of progress and debate:

1. **[[Extended and Embodied Mind]] Theories:** The idea that cognition and, by extension, the mind is not confined to the brain but extends into the body and the environment has gained significant traction. This includes work on how tools and technology become integrated into our cognitive processes.

2. **[[Consciousness]] Studies:** There has been ongoing research into the nature of consciousness, including theories about what consciousness is and how it emerges from non-conscious processes. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) are examples of theories that have been extensively discussed and developed during this period.

3. **Neurophilosophy:** The integration of philosophy with neuroscience has deepened, with philosophers working closely with neuroscientists to explore the implications of neuroscientific discoveries for understanding the mind, consciousness, free will, and personal identity.

4. **[[Artificial Intelligence]] and Mind:** Developments in AI have prompted philosophers to revisit questions about the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and the possibility of machine consciousness. This includes debates on whether AI can truly replicate human-like understanding and consciousness.

5. **[[Phenomenology]] and Cognitive Science:** There's been a resurgence of interest in phenomenology (the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view) and its relation to cognitive science, exploring how subjective experiences can inform our understanding of the mind.

6. **Philosophy of Perception:** Advances in understanding perception, especially visual perception, have prompted philosophical discussions about the nature of perceptual experience and its content. The debates around direct realism versus representational views of perception have been particularly active.

7. **[[Free Will]] and Neuroscience:** The free will debate has been invigorated by neuroscientific findings, such as those suggesting that decisions are made by unconscious brain processes before becoming conscious. Philosophers have been examining the implications of these findings for our understanding of free will and moral responsibility.

8. **Moral Psychology and Neuroethics:** The study of the biological basis of moral reasoning and ethical decision-making has grown, with implications for broader philosophical discussions about ethics and morality.

9. **[[The Problem of Personal Identity]]:** Philosophical debates about what it is that makes a person the same through time have been influenced by new theories in psychology and neuroscience, as well as by thought experiments involving technology, such as mind uploading and brain duplication.

10. **[[Panpsychism]]:** Gaining more serious consideration, panpsychism—the idea that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous aspect of the physical world—has seen a revival as a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

These developments demonstrate the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of philosophy of mind, with philosophers engaging more deeply with empirical research and scientific theories, as well as exploring new philosophical questions raised by technological advancements.
