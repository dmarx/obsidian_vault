### Tao (Dao)

The Tao, often translated as "the Way," is a central concept in [[Taoism]], described in the foundational text, the *Tao Te Ching*, traditionally attributed to Laozi. The Tao encompasses the ultimate creative principle of the universe, representing an underlying natural order and harmony in the cosmos. It is characterized by spontaneity, effortlessness (known as "wu wei"), and simplicity. This concept implies that the most effective way of living is by aligning oneself with the natural flow of the universe, thereby minimizing resistance and effort.
