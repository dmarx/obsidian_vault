Vacuum collapse, also known as vacuum decay or false vacuum decay, is a theoretical phenomenon in the field of quantum field theory (QFT) where a metastable vacuum state decays into a more stable one. This concept is intricately tied to the nature of the vacuum state in quantum fields and the possibility that our universe exists in a temporary or false vacuum state. Below, we delve into the theoretical background, the potential mechanisms of vacuum collapse, and its implications for cosmology and the universe.

### Theoretical Background

In QFT, the concept of the vacuum is more complex than just "empty space." Each type of quantum field has a potential energy associated with different configurations or states. A vacuum state, in this context, is the state of lowest energy. However, this does not necessarily mean it is the absolute lowest or the "true" vacuum. If the current vacuum state is not the state of lowest possible energy (true vacuum), it is termed a false vacuum.

A false vacuum is stable under small perturbations but potentially unstable under larger fluctuations or specific quantum events. If a false vacuum exists, it is theoretically possible for it to transition to a true vacuum state. This transition would involve a radical reconfiguration of the field values throughout the universe, significantly altering the fundamental properties of space and matter.

### Mechanism of Vacuum Collapse

The decay of a false vacuum can be described by quantum tunneling, where a field in the false vacuum state "tunnels" through a potential barrier to reach the true vacuum state. This process can be initiated spontaneously in a localized region of space, forming a bubble of true vacuum that expands at nearly the speed of light.

The transition can be modeled using the [[theory of bubble nucleation in a first-order phase transition]]. The rate of this transition per unit volume can be expressed by:
$$ \Gamma = A e^{-B/\hbar} $$
where $A$ is a prefactor with dimensions of inverse volume-time, $B$ is the action under the potential barrier between the false and true vacua, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The action $B$ typically depends on the details of the field's potential energy function.

### Cosmological Implications

The idea of vacuum collapse has profound implications for cosmology. If our universe exists in a false vacuum, a transition to a true vacuum could have catastrophic consequences, as the laws of physics and the fundamental constants could change drastically within the true vacuum bubble. However, current theoretical models and observational data suggest that if such a transition is possible, it is exceedingly unlikely within the lifespan of the universe as we observe it.

### Influence on the Standard Model of Particle Physics

In the Standard Model of particle physics, the stability of the vacuum is closely tied to the mass of the Higgs boson and the top quark. Calculations suggest that the current electroweak vacuum is metastable, meaning it is stable against small perturbations but not necessarily against all possible fluctuations over extremely long timescales.

### Conclusion

Vacuum collapse remains a speculative but potentially critical aspect of our understanding of the universe. It provides a dramatic illustration of how quantum field theory and cosmology intersect, offering insights into the stability of the universe and the fundamental nature of matter and energy. The study of vacuum states, especially in the context of the expanding universe and high-energy physics experiments, continues to be a vital area of research in theoretical physics.
