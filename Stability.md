Stability is a fundamental concept in control theory, indicating whether a system's output will remain bounded over time for a bounded input. For linear systems, stability can often be assessed using the system's [[Transfer Function]] by examining the poles of the function. For nonlinear systems, stability analysis might involve methods like [[Lyapunov's second method]].
