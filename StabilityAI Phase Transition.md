company grew, became an entity unto itself.

phase transition after which the behavior of the collective is no longer best described by the local behaviors of its constituent individuals.

this is why Corporations are psychopathic: they are a fundamentally different kind of entity from the people that comprise them and have different drives and attractive/repulsive forces that may not be in the best interests of their constituent parts.

> # [How did OpenAI go from doing exciting research to a big-tech-like company?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1cvslyc/d_how_did_openai_go_from_doing_exciting_research/)
> I was recently revisiting OpenAI’s paper on [DOTA2 Open Five](https://cdn.openai.com/dota-2.pdf), and it’s so impressive what they did there from both engineering and research standpoint. Creating a distributed system of 50k CPUs for the rollout, 1k GPUs for training while taking between 8k and 80k actions from 16k observations per 0.25s—how crazy is that?? They also were doing “surgeries” on the RL model to recover weights as their reward function, observation space, and even architecture has changed over the couple months of training. Last but not least, they beat the OG team (world champions at the time) and deployed the agent to play live with other players online.
>Fast forward a couple of years, they are predicting the next token in a sequence. Don’t get me wrong, the capabilities of gpt4 and its omni version are truly amazing feat of engineering and research (probably much more useful), but they don’t seem to be as interesting (from the research perspective) as some of their previous work.
>So, now I am wondering how did the engineers and researchers transition throughout the years? Was it mostly due to their financial situation and need to become profitable or is there a deeper reason for their transition?

I think this is an [[Emergence|emergent]] property of the size and complexity of modern tech companies. Once they go above a particular threshold of size/complexity (wrt their internal structure and operations), the activities of the collective are no longer best explained by the motivations or behaviors of individuals but rather considering the collective as a whole, as an entity in itself. Like a cell in your body, or a fish in a complex reef ecosystem ([[holobiont]]). Same thing happened to Stability. Stability AI had an absolutely insane concentration of intelligence, talent, and goodwill in its employee population. But the company they (we/I) built didn't have a sufficiently strong vision of itself to maintain a cohesion between the ideals of its constituent employees, and the external behaviors of the company as a collective.
